All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
