 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
