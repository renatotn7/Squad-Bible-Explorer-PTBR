Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.
For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
