Exodus 12:5,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Exodus,commentary,5,True,,,,Ibn Ezra on Exodus 12:5:1,Ex,12,5,"YOUR LAMB SHALL BE WITHOUT BLEMISH. It shall be without any deformity. The word <i>seh</i> (lamb) also applies to the two kinds<sup class=""footnote-marker"">182</sup><i class=""footnote"">Not only does the term <i>tzon</i> take in two kinds but the word <i>seh</i> also takes in two kinds.</i> taken in by the term <i>tzon</i> (flock).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">183</sup><i class=""footnote"">It refers to sheep and goats, as is explicitly stated in our verse, namely, <i>ye shall take it</i> (the seh) <i>from the sheep, or from the goats</i>.</i> <i>Sehkhevasim ve-seh izzim</i> (the sheep and the goat) (Deut. 14:4) is similar. Rabbi Moses ben Amram Ha-Parsi<sup class=""footnote-marker"">184</sup><i class=""footnote"">A Karaite commentator on the Bible.</i> says that the obligation to offer a lamb only pertains to the Passover brought in Egypt. However, in the Land of Israel one could sacrifice a lamb or a bull. He offers as proof, <i>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd</i> (Deut. 16:2), which applies to the Passover to be offered in all future generations. However, he did speak correctly. All future Passover offerings are in memory of the paschal lamb offered in Egypt, and one should not deviate from it. The meaning of the aforementioned verse can only be: <i>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God of the flock</i> as an obligation; <i>and of the herd</i>, bring peace offerings to be eaten cooked in water. Similarly, <i>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter</i> (Deut. 16:14) means thou art obligated;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">185</sup><i class=""footnote"">To come to the temple on a pilgrimage and rejoice before the Lord.</i> thy son and thy daughter are permitted to do so. Proof of the above is found in the book of Chronicles.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">186</sup><i class=""footnote"">II Chron. 35: 1-13.</i> We read there that on the fourteenth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">187</sup><i class=""footnote"">Of the first month.</i> they slaughtered lambs and bullocks.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">188</sup><i class=""footnote"">II Chron. 35:1.</i> It is written there that the lambs were for Passover offerings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">189</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:7.</i> and the bullocks which served as peace offerings were cooked in pots and caldrons.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i></i> Only those sacrifices which came from the flock were roasted in the fire according to ordinance.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">191</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i></i> Rabbi Joshua says that there is a difference between <i>ben shanah</i> (of the first year)<sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Our verse states that the paschal lamb is to be a <i>ben shanah</i>.</i> and <i>ben shenato</i> (of the first year). A <i>ben shanah</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">193</sup><i class=""footnote"">That is, a lamb that is a <i>ben shanah</i>.</i> has lived a year and <i>ben shenato</i> means exactly what Scripture says.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">194</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ben shenato</i> literally means of its year, i.e., during its first year of life.</i> Now with regard to the sacrifices offered by the princes it first states, <i>keves echad ben shenato leolah</i> (one he-lamb of the first year, for a burnt-offering) (Num. 7:15) and then states, <i>kevasim bene shanah</i> (he-lambs of the first year) (Num. 7:87).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">195</sup><i class=""footnote"">Scripture tells us that each one of the princes of the tribes of Israel offered a <i>keves ben shenato</i> for a burnt offering. Scripture then gives the number of burnt offerings as <i>kevasim bene shanah shenem asar</i> (he-lambs of the first year twelve). We thus see that the terms <i>ben shanah</i> and <i>ben shenato</i> are one and the same. Therefore Rabbi Joshua is incorrect. I might add that both Krinsky and Weiser missed I.E.’s point. Both indicate that I.E.’s proof is from the five he-lambs of the first year (<i>bene shanah</i>) brought as peace offerings. However, there is no proof from the latter because the peace offering differs from the burnt offering, and one can argue that Scripture required a lamb under a year for a burnt offering and a lamb over a year for a peace offering.</i>"

Exodus 12:5,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar,,5,True,,,,Sifrei Bamidbar 65:1,Ex,12,5," (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.9.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 9:2"">Bamidbar 9:2</a>) ""And the children of Israel shall offer the Pesach in its appointed time"": Why is this stated? (i.e., Isn't it obvious?) From (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.12.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 12:6"">Shemot 12:6</a>) ""and the whole congregation of Israel shall slaughter it (the Paschal lamb),"" I might think, either on a weekday or on Sabbath (as the case may be). And how would I satisfy (Ibid. 31:14) ""Its (Sabbath's) desecrators shall be put to death""? With other labors, other than slaughtering the Paschal lamb. — Or, even with slaughtering the Paschal lamb. And how would I satisfy ""and they shall slaughter it""? (If it falls out) on other days, other than Sabbath. It is, therefore, written ""And the children of Israel shall offer the Pesach in its appointed time"" (— even on the Sabbath). These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan (to R. Yoshiyah): This is not sufficient (for the derivation [i.e., ""in its appointed time"" may mean if it does not fall out on a Sabbath.]) R. Yoshiyah (to R. Yonathan): Rather, it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.28.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 28:2"">Bamidbar 28:2</a>) ""Command the children of Israel and say to them … to offer (the tamid) offering to Me in its appointed time."" If (the intent of this is) to teach that the tamid offering overrides Sabbath, this is not needed; for it is already written (Ibid. 9) ""And on the Sabbath day, (there are to be sacrificed) two lambs of the first year … (10) the burnt-offering of the Sabbath in its Sabbath in addition to the daily burnt-offering, etc."" What, then, is the intent (of ""in its appointed time"")? It is ""extra,"" to signal the formulation of an identity, viz.: it is written here ""in its appointed time,"" and elsewhere (re the Paschal lamb) ""in its appointed time."" Just as ""its appointed time"" here overrides Sabbath, so, ""its appointed time"" there overrides Sabbath. ""On the fourteenth day of this month, towards evening shall you offer it, in its appointed time."": What is the intent of this? Is it not already written ""The children of Israel shall offer it in its appointed time""? Why, again, ""in its appointed time""? Scripture hereby comes to teach us that just as the first Pesach (as opposed to Pesach Sheni) overrides the Sabbath, so it overrides (communal) uncleanliness. For (without this verse,) it would follow otherwise, viz.: If (the slaughtering of) the red heifer, which does not override the Sabbath overrides (communal) uncleanliness, the first Pesach, which overrides the Sabbath, how much more so should it override uncleanliness? — This is refuted by the second Pesach, which even though it overrides the Sabbath, does not override uncleanliness. And this would indicate of the first Pesach that even though it overrides the Sabbath, it does not override uncleanliness. It is, therefore, written ""in its appointed time,"" to teach concerning the first Pesach that just as it overrides the Sabbath it overrides uncleanliness. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) ""According to all of its statutes"": These are the mitzvoth (directly) pertaining to its body, viz. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.12.5"" data-ref=""Exodus 12:5"">Shemot 12:5</a>) ""an unblemished lamb, a male, of the first year."" ""its ordinances"": These are the mitzvoth attendant upon its body, viz. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.16.3"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 16:3"">Devarim 16:3</a>) ""Seven days shall you eat matzoth 'upon' it."" ""according to all its ordinances"": to include mitzvoth not attendant upon its body — the eating of matzoh for seven days and the burning of chametz."
Exodus 12:5,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar,,5,True,,,,Sifrei Bamidbar 69:2,Ex,12,5," (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.9.9-10"" data-ref=""Numbers 9:9-10"">Bamidbar 9:9-10</a>) ""And the L-rd spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A man if he be unclean by a dead body, etc."": This is something that he (Moses) asked (of the L-rd). ""or on a distant way"": This is something that he did not ask. ""if he be unclean by a dead body."" This tells me only of one who is tamei by a dead body. Whence do I derive (the same [i.e., that Pesach Sheni is observed] for) other types of tumah? From ""or if he were on a distant way."" You induce (binyan av) from both, viz.: ""tamei by a dead body"" is not like ""distant way,"" and ""distant way"" is not like ""tamei by a dead body."" What is common to both is that one who did not observe the first Pesach observes Pesach Sheni — So, all who could not observe the first Pesach observe Pesach Sheni. ""on a distant way"": I do not know what constitutes ""a distant way."" R. Akiva says: It is written ""tamei by a dead body"" and ""distant way."" Just as in the fist instance, he desired to observe but could not, so, in the second, he desired to observe but could not; and the sages delimited (""distant way"" as applying to) anyone who at the time of the slaughtering of the Paschal lamb was at a distance from Modi'im (fifteen miles from Jerusalem) and beyond, along the entire circumference. R. Eliezer says ""distant way"" is stated in respect to the tithe (viz. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.14.24"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 14:24"">Devarim 14:24</a>), and ""distant way"" is stated in respect to Pesach. Just as ""distant way"" in respect to the tithe connotes outside the place where it is eaten, so, ""distant way"" in respect to Pesach. Which is the place where it is eaten? From the entrance of Jerusalem within. R. Yehudah says: ""distant way"" is stated in respect to Pesach, and ""distant way"" is stated in respect to the tithe. Just as ""distant way"" in respect to Pesach connotes outside the place of its (the Paschal lamb's) fitness, (i.e., the azarah [the Temple court]) so, ""distant way"" in respect to the tithe. And what is the place of its fitness? (All of Jerusalem) from the azarah outwards."
Exodus 12:5,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar,,5,True,,,,Sifrei Bamidbar 107:2,Ex,12,5," (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:2"">Bamidbar 15:2</a>) ""Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land of your settlings which I give to you, etc."": Scripture comes to teach us that Israel were obligated to bring libations (with their offerings) only after inheritance and settlement (of the land [viz. Ibid. 15:5]). You say after inheritance and settlement, but perhaps immediately upon their entry to the land. It is, therefore, written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.17.14"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 17:14"">Devarim 17:14</a>) ""When you come to the land that the L-rd your G-d gives to you, and you inherit it and you settle in it, etc."" Since ""comings"" are mentioned in the Torah unqualified, and in one instance (above) it is specified, after inheritance and settlement, so all (""comings"" are understood as) after inheritance and settlement, which teaches us that wherever ""settlings"" is written, after inheritance and settling is understood. These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva queried him: But in respect to Shabbath it is written ""settlings"" (viz. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.23.3"" data-ref=""Leviticus 23:3"">Vayikra 23:3</a>), and it obtains both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of it! R. Yishmael replied: If ""lighter"" mitzvoth obtain both in the land and outside it, how much more so, Shabbath, the ""graver."" And it (""settlings"") comes to teach that in an individual altar (""bamah"") there is no obligation to bring libations. R. Akiva says: Scripture comes to teach us that libations are to be offered on a bamah. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: Why is this (""When you come to the land"") written? For it would follow, since we find that the vessels of the Temple were more than those of the tent of meeting (viz. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.7.27"" data-ref=""I Kings 7:27"">I Kings 7:27</a>), so, the libations of the Temple were more than those of the tent of meeting; it is, therefore, written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:2"">Bamidbar 15:2</a>) ""When you come … (3) and you shall offer, etc."" to teach that even though there were more vessels in the Temple than in the tent of meeting, there were not more libations. (Ibid. 3) ""and you shall offer a fire-offering to the L-rd"": This implies that all that is offered for the fire requires libations, even a meal-offering. It is, therefore, written ""a burnt-offering."" This tells me only of a burnt-offering (that it requires libations). Whence do I derive (the same for) peace-offerings? From ""a sacrifice."" Whence do I derive (the same for) a thank-offering? From ""or a sacrifice."" This would imply (that libations are required) for these as well as for first-born, tithe, Pesach and guilt-offering. It is, therefore, written ""for an expressed vow or as a guilt-offering."" Scripture speaks only of offerings that are brought as vow and gift. — But this would imply that I exclude them (from libations) as well as mandatory festival offerings! — It is, therefore, written ""or in your festivals,"" to include these (as requiring libations). — But this would imply (that libations are required for) burnt-offerings and mandatory peace-offerings that are brought on festivals, and for a mandatory sin-offering that is brought on festivals! — It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 15;8) ""And if you offer a bullock as a burnt-offering or as a sacrifice."" ""Bullock"" was included in the general category (of offerings) and departed from it (for specific mention) to teach about the category, viz.: Just as ""bullock,"" which is brought for vow or gift (requires libations, so, all (offerings) that are brought for vow or gift require libations) — to exclude sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, which are not brought for vow or gift."

He might have been tempted to do so in order to escape the wrath of the Egyptian from whom he had purchased it by saying that he had not taken an Egyptian deity, since surely the Egyptians do not worship blemished animals, nor female animals or overage, weak animals, so that he had not committed blasphemy in their eyes. The Torah spells all this out by writing: “unblemished, male, less than a year old.” The Egyptians would raise the price of these animals when aware that the Israelites would use it in the service of their G-d. The Torah wanted the Jews to pay the price of such animals, although at that stage, they could have simply taken the animal without paying for it, as they no longer were afraid of their former masters. These had realised that they were not able to save their animals from the Israelites as long as these were still in their city.

Isaiah 40:8,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah,,8,True,,,,Bamidbar Rabbah 16:3,Is,40,8,"1 A legal teaching: Is it permitted to set sail on the Great Sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) three days before the Sabbath? Our masters taught (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.19a"" data-ref=""Shabbat 19a"">Shab. 19a</a>): One does not set sail in a ship on the Great Sea three days before the Sabbath, when one wants to go to a distant place. If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go [there] while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for [carrying out] a commandment, it is permitted for [such a] one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for [carrying out] a commandment, and an agent for [carrying out] a commandment overrides the Sabbath. And so you find with reference to the sukkah that they have taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 2:4), “Agents for [carrying out] a religious duty are exempted from [the requirements of] the sukkah.”<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Suk.</i> 25a (bar).</i> You have none so dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, as an agent, when he is sent to carry out a religious duty and is risking his life to succeed in it. And you have none who were sent to carry out a religious duty and who risked their lives to succeed in their mission like those two whom Joshua ben Nun sent. Thus it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.2.1"" data-ref=""Joshua 2:1"">Josh. 2:1</a>), “Then Joshua ben Nun sent two [spies] from Shittim [secretly, saying]….” Who were they? Our masters have taught, “These were Phinehas and Caleb.” They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of secretly (<i>heresh</i>)? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried, “Here are pots. Whoever wants [some], let him come and buy.” [Their ruse was] so that no one would notice them. [Hence secretly (<i>heresh</i>) is written [in this verse,] but read it [as] clay (<i>heres</i>), (from which pots are made). [They had made themselves out to be potters] lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.) “So they went and came to the house of a woman who was a harlot whose name was Rahab […]”: She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to investigate the whole land, as stated (in vs. 2), “But it was told the king of Jericho [….].” When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>), as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Malachi.2.7"" data-ref=""Malachi 2:7"">Mal. 2:7</a>), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, and they seek Torah from his mouth, because he is a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord of hosts.” Now an angel desiring [to be visible] is visible; and one desiring [to be invisible] is not visible. And from where is it known that the prophets are also comparable to angels. As so is it stated about Moses (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.20.16"" data-ref=""Numbers 20:16"">Numb. 20:16</a>), “and he sent a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) who brought us out of Egypt.” And was it an angel? And was he not Moses? Hence the prophets are likened to angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>). And so too is it stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.2.1"" data-ref=""Judges 2:1"">Jud. 2:1</a>), “An angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, ‘I brought you up from Egypt…” And was he not Phinehas? It is simply that from here [it is shown] that the prophets are called angels. Hence Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and I do not need to hide. Hide my colleague, Caleb, and I will stand in front of them but they will not see me.” And so did she do, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.2.4"" data-ref=""Joshua 2:4"">Josh. 2:4</a>), “So the woman took the two men [and hid <i>him</i>].” It does not say, “hid them,” but rather “hid him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Him</i> is a literal translation of the Masoretic text.</i>” Behold that she did not hide Phinehas, but rather [only] Caleb. [This is] to teach you how much these two righteous men risked themselves to fulfill their mission. But the agents whom Moses sent were wicked. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.13.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 13:2"">Numb. 13:2</a>) “Send men.”"

Because this was the meeting place for the court. Therefore on Rosh HaShana which fell out on Shabbat the shofar is not blown anywhere except at Eintav, in the place where the court sat and intercalated the years and months.

Rather they stand with excitement and dismay, while the righteous are able to hear His voice. It is so stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joel.2.11"" data-ref=""Joel 2:11"">Joel 2:11</a>), “The Lord shouts aloud before His army, for His host is very great, for mighty is the one who fulfills His word.” “His host” denotes angels, since it is stated (regarding angels in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.32.3"" data-ref=""Genesis 32:3"">Gen. 32:3</a>), “This is God's host.” And so it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Daniel.7.10"" data-ref=""Daniel 7:10"">Dan. 7:10</a>), “thousands upon thousands ministered to Him.” And who is stronger than them?

Then he stood alone outside, because he was afraid to enter the tent of meeting, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.40.35"" data-ref=""Exodus 40:35"">Exod. 40:35</a>), “Now Moses could not enter the tent of meeting.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “It is not right for Moses, since he made the tabernacle, to stand outside while I stand inside; so look, I am calling upon him to enter.” It is therefore written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.1"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:1"">Lev. 1:1</a>), “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses.” Ergo, greater is the strength of the righteous, in that they are able to hear His voice!

Among other proofs the author has cited is <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.25.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 25:2"">Leviticus 25,2</a>, where the Torah wrote: ושבתה הארץ, that the soil of the land of Israel is to observe a year of lying fallow, (immediately after the Israelites entering that land) and the Torah proceeds to lists the laws pertaining to the sh’mittah cycles followed by the Jubilee cycles, concluding with 26,46: “these are the statutes and social laws that G-d has given as applying to the Jewish people all of which He had revealed to Moses at Mount Sinai.” The Jewish people heard and accepted all the laws including the blessings and curses applying to those who observed them and those who would disobey them, after which Moses took the remainder of the blood and sprinkled it upon them, as the seal of the covenant. He told the people to listen to detailed instructions of these laws starting on the day following. [In other words, the Jews had already bound themselves to be obedient to the Torah’s laws even though they had not yet been written down. There is considerable discussion about the term ספר הברית, here whether what was already written in there at the time Moses read from it was subsequently written in the Torah out of context or not. According to our author’s interpretation of the Mechilta when the Israelites said their famous: נעשה ונשמע generally understood as their giving G-d a blank cheque, this was not so, they simply expressed the wish to learn the details of what Moses had already read out to them.

Exodus 24:7,Talmud,Avot D'Rabbi Natan,,7.0,True,,,,Avot D'Rabbi Natan 20:1,Ex,24,7,"Rabbi Hananya, deputy of the priests, would say: Anyone who takes words of Torah to heart is no longer troubled by thoughts of destruction, thoughts of hunger, foolish thoughts, lustful thoughts, thoughts of temptation, thoughts of another man’s wife, thoughts of meaningless things, or thoughts of human burden. So it was written in the book of Psalms by King David (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.19.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 19:9"">Psalms 19:9</a>), “The precepts of the Eternal are true, bringing joy to the heart. The commandments of the Eternal are clear, illuminating the eyes.” But anyone who does not take words of Torah to heart is troubled by thoughts of destruction, thoughts of hunger, foolish thoughts, lustful thoughts, thoughts of temptation, thoughts of another man’s wife, thoughts of meaningless things, and thoughts of human burden. So it was written in Deuteronomy (28:46–48) by Moses our teacher, “They will be a sign and a proof against you and your offspring for all time. Because you would not serve the Eternal your God with joy and gladness over the abundance of everything. You will have to serve, in hunger and in thirst, naked and lacking everything.” “In hunger.” How so? (When a person wishes) to eat even barley bread, but has nothing, and then his enemies come and ask him for wheat bread and fatty meat. “In thirst.” How so? When a person wishes he could drink just a drop of vinegar, or beer, but has nothing, and then his enemies come and ask him for the finest wine in the land. “Naked.” How so? When a person wants to wear a wool or linen shirt, but has nothing, and then his enemies come and ask him for the finest silk in the land. “Lacking everything.” Without a candle, without a knife, and without a table. Another interpretation of “lacking everything”: Without vinegar and without salt. For this is a curse that people often give: May there be no vinegar or salt in your house!<br>He would also say (with regard to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.1.6"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 1:6"">Song of Songs 1:6</a>): “Do not look at me, for I am blackened, scorched by the sun.” These are all the Jewish girls who cast off the yolk of the Holy Blessed One, and accepted human kingship upon themselves.<br>[The verse continues:] “My mother’s children were angry with me.” This is Moses, who killed the Egyptian, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.11-12"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:11-12"">Exodus 2:11–12</a>), “Sometime after that, when Moses had grown older, he went out among his brothers and saw what they were enduring…and he turned this way and that, and saw that there was no one there.” What do we learn from “there was no one there”? This teaches that Moses brought the question before the council of angels who serve God, and asked them: Shall I kill this man? They said to him: Yes, kill him. And did Moses kill him with a sword? No, he killed him with words, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.14"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:14"">Exodus 2:14</a>), “Are you <i>saying</i> you will kill me, just as you killed the Egyptian?” This teaches that Moses killed him by saying the [Ineffable] Name of God.<br>(Another interpretation of) “My mother’s children are angry with me”: this is Moses, who fled to Midian, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.15"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:15"">Exodus 2:15</a>,17), “Pharaoh heard what happened, and sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh. He arrived in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well…And some shepherds came and tried to drive [Jethro’s daughters] away. And Moses got up and saved them, and gave water to their flocks.” Then Moses came and sat among them to render judgment. He said: The general practice in the world is for men to fill the buckets and women to give water to the animals. Here, women draw the water and men give the water to the animals. There is a perversion of justice in this place! (They are guilty by law, and have become guilty through this incident.) Some say that the whole time Moses was standing near the mouth of the well, the water was bubbling up to meet him, and when he left, the water went back down. Then Moses said: Woe is me! For I have left my people and come to live among these heathens.<br>Another interpretation of “My mother’s children are angry with me”: This is Israel, who made the Golden Calf.

(b) Since these laws are so fundamental, men, women, and children were all present when Moses addressed them, whereas in the other sections of the Torah only the elders and the men were present.</i> this being the reason for the expression, <i>speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</i>. This section, however, was mentioned here in [the book of] <i>Torath Kohanim</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Literally: “the Law of the Priests,” which is another name for the Book of Vayikra, or Leviticus. In other words, since the laws of this section are so fundamental to the entire congregation of Israel, why were they placed in the book which is essentially devoted to the laws of the priests and the offerings? The answer follows in the text.</i> because it contains laws concerning the thanks-offering,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Tur, quoting the language of Ramban, writes: “peace-offerings.” That is correct, since the following verses [5-8] refer only to the peace-offerings, and not the thanks-offering. There are important differences between them. A thanks-offering may be eaten only on the same day that it was slaughtered until midnight, whilst a peace-offering could be eaten for two days and the intervening night.

The objective of all these parts of Torah legislation was to establish a nation that could be described as “holy,” not least of it the legislation concerning incest.<br> At this point, i.e. after achieving this “holiness,” i.e. emulating the Creator’s holiness in the maximum manner possible for creatures, the Torah spells out this objective by saying כי קדוש אני, “For I the Lord am holy;” the message is that the original intention in creating man in the image of G’d (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.26"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:26"">Genesis 1,26</a>) had already had as its declared goal for this “image” to become something constant.

Leviticus 19:2,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus,commentary,2.0,True,,,,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 19:2:1,Lv,19,2,"<b> <span class=""font1"">אל כל עדת בני ישראל</span>, ""to the whole community of the children of Israel.""</b> <i>Torat Kohanim</i> explains why the Torah writes the words ""to all."" Seeing that most of the important commandments of the Torah are contained in this portion Moses addressed them to the whole nation as outlined in <i>Eyruvin</i> 54. Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi describes the logistics of this [seeing they did not have a public address system in those days, Ed.] as distinctly different from other occasions when Moses revealed legislation. Whereas usually the people approached Moses in group after group- ""a group"" meaning a <span class=""font1"">בית אב</span>,- in this instance they all approached simultaneously. This is very difficult. If the Rabbi meant that whereas usually the elders came to Moses first to be followed by the people at large in groups, Moses would have had to repeat the same lecture more than 65 times. According to the <i>Baraitha</i> in <i>Eyruvin</i> 54 Moses taught the same legislation only four times. The Talmud there describes that by the time Moses taught the legislation to the people at large, Aaron had heard it four times, etc. If Rabbi Mizrachi meant by the words ""group after group,"" that Aaron was one group, Nadav and Avihu a second group, and the elders a third group, whereas in this instance the Israelites, the elders, Nadav and Avihu and Aaron all came at the same time, the question is why Moses used a different system when he taught all the other commandments. Why did Moses not teach all of the people these commandments 4 times? Surely if the other commandments warranted that Aaron would hear them 4 times, in this instance it was warranted that all the people hear these commandments 4 times! It would be better if they heard it each time from Moses directly than just once, and the other times only from people who themselves had heard it only from Moses. I believe there are one of two possible reasons for the manner in which Moses normally taught the Torah precepts G'd had revealed to him. 1) He wanted to accord honour to the different levels of spiritual achievements attained by his respective listeners. Accordingly, he would first honour Aaron, then his sons, followed by the elders, and finally the people at large. 2) He wanted to ensure true transmission of his words. Seeing that he taught each group of people separately, when they in turn discussed what they had learned they would be able to compare if each one remembered exactly the same. If the entire people had learned the same lesson from Moses four times in a row, there would not have been any way to compare any discrepancies due to someone's faulty memory. This is something that the listener would be well aware of. It would therefore have been better to follow the pattern of teaching the legislation separately to different groups at different times in this portion also. Why would Moses deprive Aaron of his privileged status when teaching this legislation, or, why would he deprive everyone of the chance to double-check if he heard and remembered correctly? The more important the legislation, the more important that there should be unanimity about exactly what the legislation consisted of! On the other hand, if it was appropriate to teach these commandments to all the people at the same time, why was it not appropriate to have done so with the commandments Moses revealed prior to this occasion? It appears, at least when we look at this superficially, that the Torah's departure from its norm in this case represented a change for the worse!"

""tzitzith"": ""tzitzith"" is something which ""protrudes"" (""yotzeh"") somewhat. And the elders of Beth Shammai and those of Beth Hillel have already entered the upper chamber of Yonathan b. Betheira and declared: Tzitzith have no prescribed size. And they declared, similarly: A lulav has no prescribed size. ""and they shall make for themselves tzitzith."" I might think that one string suffices; it is, therefore, written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.12"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:12"">Devarim 22:12</a>) ""Fringes (shall you make for yourself."") How many fringes? Not fewer than three. These are the words of Beth Hillel. Beth Shammai say: Three of wool and the fourth of tcheleth (blue linen). And the halachah is in accordance with Beth Shammai. When is this so (that a minimum size is required)? In the beginning (of its attachment). But for what is left over or lopped off any size (is sufficient). (Bamidbar, Ibid.) ""and they shall make for themselves tzitzith."" I might think that all of it shall be tzitzith; it is, therefore, written ""fringes."" If ""fringes,"" I might think all of it shall be fringes. It is, therefore, written ""tzitzith."" How is this (to be implemented)? That its fringes protrude from the corner (of the garment), and tzitzith from the fringes. ""in the corners of their garments"": I might think, even garments that are three-cornered, five-cornered, six-cornered, seven-cornered, and eight-cornered; it is, therefore, written (Devarim, Ibid.) ""on the four corners of your garment,"" to exclude the aforementioned. And whence is it derived that pillows and covers are (also) excluded (from tzitzith)? From (Ibid.) ""wherewith you cover yourself."" If from there, I would think that night-clothes are also included (as requiring tzitzith). It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) ""and you shall see it"" — in the daytime and not at night. And if it were intended both for day and night, it requires tzitzith. I might think that this excludes both the above and the garment of a blind man; it is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) ""And it shall be for you for tzitzith"" — in any event (i.e., to include a blind man). (Ibid. 38) ""and they shall place on the tzitzith (on) the corner a strand of tcheleth"": spun and doubled. This tells me only of the tcheleth, that it is to be spun and doubled. Whence do I derive (the same for) the white (i.e., the wool)? You derive it by induction, viz.: Since the Torah said: ""place"" tcheleth and ""place"" white, just as tcheleth is spun and doubled, so, white is spun and doubled. ""and they shall place"": on the place of the weaving (i.e., the corner of the garment), and not on the place of the ""growing"" (i.e., the strands at the corner of the garment). If he did place it on the site of the ""growing,"" it is (nonetheless) kasher. R. Eliezer b. Yaakov includes it both on the ""growing"" and on the very edge of the garment, it being written ""on the corners of their garments."" ""and they shall place on the tzitzith (on) the corner"": What is the intent of this? From ""and they shall make for themselves tzitzith, I might think that he should weave it (the tzitzith) together with it (the garment; it is, therefore, written ""and they shall place."" How so? He ties it (the tzitzith) together with it (the garment). (Ibid. 39) ""And it shall be to you for tzitzith"": The four tzitzith are mutually inclusive (i.e., in the absence of one there is no mitzvah), the four being one mitzvah. R. Yishmael says: They are four mitzvoth. R. Elazar b. R. Shimon says: Why is it called ""tcheleth""? Because the Egyptians were ""bereaved"" (""nitkelu"" [like ""tcheleth""]) of their first-born, viz. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.12.29"" data-ref=""Exodus 12:29"">Shemot 12:29</a>) ""And it was in the middle of the night, that the L-rd smote every first-born, etc."" Variantly: Because the Egyptians were ""destroyed"" (""kalu"") in the Red Sea. Why is it called ""tzitzith""? Because the L-rd ""looked"" (""hetzith"") over our fathers' houses in Egypt, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.2.9"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 2:9"">Song of Songs 2:9</a>) ""The voice of My Beloved, behold, it is coming … My Beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart … Behold, He stands behind our wall, looking through the windows, peering through the lattices."" R. Chanina b. Antignos says: One who fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, what is said of him? (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zechariah.8.23"" data-ref=""Zechariah 8:23"">Zechariah 8:23</a>) ""In these days it will happen that ten men, of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the corner (i.e., of the tzitzith) of a Jewish man, saying 'Let us go with you, for we have heard that G-d is with you!'"" And one who nullifies the mitzvah of ""the corner,"" what is said of him? (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.38.13"" data-ref=""Job 38:13"">Iyyov 38:13</a>) ""to take hold of the corners of the earth and to shake the wicked from it!"" R. Meir says: It is not written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) ""And you shall see them"" (the tzitzith), but ""And you shall see Him."" Scripture hereby apprises us that if one fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, it is reckoned unto him as if he beheld the face of the Shechinah. For tcheleth is reminiscent of (the color of) the sea; the sea, of the firmament; and the firmament, of the Throne of Glory, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.1.26"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 1:26"">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) ""And above the firmament that was over their heads … (28) the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the L-rd."" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) ""and you shall see and you shall remember"": See this mitzvah and remember another mitzvah, (which is contingent upon it.) Which is that? The recitation of the Shema — But perhaps (the reference is to) one of all the other mitzvoth of the Torah. It is, therefore, written (in the section of tzitzith, Ibid. 41) ""I am the L-rd your G-d,"" which you find to be written only in (the section of) the recitation of the Shema. ""and you shall remember"": Remember (i.e., recite) the section with your mouth. I might think that the section ""vehaya im shamoa"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.11.13-21"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 11:13-21"">Devarim 11:13-21</a>) should precede all of the sections. — Would you say that? The section of Shema (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.6.4-9"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 6:4-9"">Devarim 6:4-9</a>), which contains acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven should precede ""vehaya im shamoa,"" which contains acceptance of the yoke of mitzvoth, and ""vehaya im shamoa,"" which obtains both in the daytime and at night, should precede the section of tzitzith (""vayomer"" [<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.37-41"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:37-41"">Bamidbar 15:37-41</a>]), which obtains only in the daytime. And perhaps he should recite three (sections) in the evening as he does in the daytime. It is, therefore, written (of tzitzith [<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.39"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:39"">Bamidbar 15:39</a>]) ""and you shall see it"" — in the daytime and not at night. R. Shimon b. Yochai says: The section of Shema, which contains (the mitzvah of) learning (Torah), should precede ""vehaya im shamoa,"" which speaks only of teaching. And ""vehaya im shamoa"" should precede the section of tzitzith, which is only to do (i.e., the final stage). For thus was Torah given: to learn and to teach, to keep and to do: ""And you shall see it, and you shall remember (all the mitzvoth of the L-rd, and you shall do them.""): Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If one who fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, (which is only a sign and a remembrance towards the doing of mitzvoth,) is accounted as one who has fulfilled all of the mitzvoth, how much more so (is this true of) one who (actively) performs (any one of) all the mitzvoth of the Torah! ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts"": This is heresy, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.7.26"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 7:26"">Koheleth 7:26</a>) ""And I find more bitter than death 'the woman' (heresy), whose heart is snares and nets. Her hands are bonds. The good before G-d shall escape her."" ""and after your eyes"": This is harlotry, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.14.3"" data-ref=""Judges 14:3"">Judges 14:3</a>) ""Take her for me, for she is just in my eyes."" ""after which you go astray"": This is idolatry, as it is written (Ibid. 8:33) ""and they went astray after the ba'alim."" R. Nathan says: that one not ""drink"" in this ""cup"" (i.e., his own wife), and cast his gaze at the ""cup"" of another. Variantly: ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts and after your eyes"": This teaches us that the eyes follow the heart. — But perhaps the heart follows the eyes! Would you say that? Are there not blind men who commit all the abominations in the world? What, then, is the intent of ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts, etc.""? That the eyes follow the heart. R. Yishmael says: ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts"": What is the intent of this? From (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.11.9"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 11:9"">Koheleth 11:9</a>) ""Rejoice young man in your youth (… and walk in the ways of your heart""), (I would not know whether) in a way that is straight or in (any) way that you like; it is, therefore, written ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts."" (Ibid. 40) ""So that you remember and you do (all of My mitzvoth): This equates remembering with doing. ""and you shall be holy to your G-d"": This refers to the holiness of all of the mitzvoth. You say the holiness of (all the) mitzvoth, but perhaps the holiness of tzitzith (is intended). — Would you say that? What is the (general) context? The holiness of all the mitzvoth. Rebbi says: The reference is to the holiness of tzitzith. You say the holiness of tzitzith, but perhaps the holiness of all the mitzvoth is intended. — (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.19.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 19:2"">Vayikra 19:2</a>) ""Holy shall you be"" already refers to the holiness of all the mitzvoth. How, then, am I to understand ""and you shall be holy to your G-d""? As referring to the holiness of tzitzith — whence it is seen that tzitzith add holiness to Israel. (Ibid. 41) ""I am the L-rd your G-d, who took you out of the land of Egypt."": Why is this mentioned here? So that one not say: I will take imitation-dyed threads (and attach them to my garment) as tcheleth, and who will know the difference? If (within the framework of) the measure of punishment, the lesser measure (of the L-rd) — if one sins in secret, He exposes him in public, (as He did in Egypt), then, (within the framework of) the measure of good, the greater measure (of the L-rd) — how much more so (does this hold true)! Variantly: Why is the exodus from Egypt mentioned in connection with every mitzvah? An analogy: The son of a king's loved one was taken captive. When he (the king) redeems him, he redeems him not as a son, but as a servant, so that if he (the son) does not accept his decree, he can say to him ""You are my servant!"" When they enter the province, he (the king) says to him: Put on my sandals and carry my things before me to the bath-house. The son begins to object, whereupon the king presents him with his writ (of servitude) and says to him: ""You are my servant!"" Thus, when the Holy One Blessed be He redeemed the seed of His loved one, He did not redeem them as ""sons,"" but as servants, so that if they reject His decree He says to them: ""You are My servants!"" When they went to the desert, He began to decree upon them some ""light"" mitzvoth and some formidable ones, such as Shabbath, illicit relations, tzitzith, and tefillin, and Israel began to object — whereupon He said to them: ""You are My servants! On that condition I redeemed you; on condition that I decree and you fulfill!"" ""I am the L-rd your G-d"": Why is this stated again? Is it not already written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.2"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:2"">Shemot 20:2</a>) ""I am the L-rd your G-d who took you out of the land of Egypt""? Why state it again? So that Israel not say: Why did the L-rd command us (to do mitzvoth)? Is it not so that we do them and receive reward? We shall not do them and we shall not receive reward! As Israel said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.20.1"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 20:1"">Ezekiel 20:1</a>) ""There came to me (Ezekiel) men of the elders of Israel to make inquiry of the L-rd, and they sat before me."" They said to him: A servant whose Master has sold him, does he not leave His domain? Ezekiel: Yes. They: Since the L-rd has sold us to the nations, we have left His domain. Ezekiel: A servant whose Master has sold him in order to return, does he leave His domain? (Ibid. 32-33) ""And what enters your minds, it shall not be, your saying: We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, to serve wood and stone. As I live, says the L-rd G-d. I swear to you that I will rule over you with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath!"" ""with a strong hand"": pestilence, as it is written (in that regard, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.9.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 9:3"">Shemot 9:3</a>) ""Behold, the hand of the L-rd is in your cattle, etc."" ""with an outstretched arm"": the sword, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Chronicles.21.16"" data-ref=""I Chronicles 21:16"">I Chronicles 21:16</a>) ""with his (the angel's) sword drawn in his hand, stretched over Jerusalem."" ""and with outpoured wrath"": famine. After I bring these three calamities upon you, one after the other, I will rule over you perforce!"
Leviticus 19:2,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,2.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Leviticus 19:2:1",Lv,19,2," קדושים תהיו, ”you shall be holy;” Our sages in <i>Torat Kohanim</i> state that this was one of the portions of the Torah which was read out in public once every seven years on <i>Sukkot</i> on the occasion of “<i>hakhel,</i>” the public reading of the Torah by the King before the assembled nation, men women and children (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.31.10"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 31:10"">Deuteronomy 31,10</a>, the penultimate of the 613 commandments). The reason was that it contains so many of the basic laws of the Torah, such as the laws about offering personal voluntary peace-offerings, the penalty for disregarding the laws abut incest and sexual mores. We must understand that holiness can only develop as a result of abstaining from all the items that the Torah has described as an abomination in the eyes of <i>Hashem.</i>
    Nachmanides writes that he has examined the wording in his edition of the <i>Torat</i> Kohanim, and has not found anything spelled out there about being especially פרוש, i.e. keeping one’s distance from the subject covered by sexual mores, but that we are to be generally פרושים, discreet, and discriminating in our conduct, as a result of which holiness will develop. [My edition of the <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, printed in <i>Torah Shleymah</i> bears out what Nachmanides writes. Ed.] G’d is quoted as saying: “just as I keep apart (from contact with what is unbecoming, so shall you keep yourself apart from contact with matters that are unbecoming for you.” It follows that the subject of פרישות includes abstaining and keeping one’s distance from all the subject matter mentioned in the Talmud as subject to such warnings by our sages. 
    Nachmanides uses as an example the fact that whereas on the one hand, the Torah has permitted sexual intercourse, it imposed limitations with whom such sexual intercourse may be indulged in, similarly, it has also permitted the eating of foods which are palatable and non poisonous, but has imposed limitations in forbidding Jews foods which gentiles clearly enjoy without apparent harmful effects. Holiness, if aspired to, is therefore possible by imposing upon oneself restrictions and not considering everything that has not been expressly forbidden as permitted, but to train oneself to be moderate in enjoying the material attractions the world has to offer. These attractions may be enjoyed when they are intended to make the performance of a commandment more meaningful both esthetically and artistically, for instance. A person intent on attaining a level of holiness would not seek out such attractions for their own sake. [When someone loves silver trinkets and collects them, this does not further his path to attaining holiness, although he did not do something forbidden. If, however, he indulges his whim by buying beautiful <i>ethrog</i> boxes, <i>mezuzah</i> housings, <i>kiddush</i> cups, etc., then he may at one and the same time indulge his sense of what is esthetically beautiful, and come closer to attaining degree of holiness.
    Our sages, in limiting the frequency of marital relations with one’s wife even, suggested that a Torah scholar limit himself to such marital intercourse once a week, while an ordinary uneducated worker is allowed to indulge in such activity more often. (Compare <i>Chagigah</i> 18, <i>Berachot,</i> 22 and other places in the Talmud) Nachmanides points out that it is possible not to violate a single one of the 613 commandments in the Torah and still not only to remain far from “holy,” but to continue to be a gross and uncouth individual, eating to excess, drinking to excess, indulging in legally permitted sex at every opportunity, etc.
    If the ideal of a Torah personality could be the result of merely not violating any of the 613 commandments, Moses would not have had to write in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.6.18"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 6:18"">Deut. 6,18</a> ועשית הישר והטוב בעיני ה', “do what is fair and good in the eyes of <i>Hashem.”</i> In<i> halachic</i> parlance, our approach to life should be to act לפנים משורת הדין, “to stay well within what is allowable legally.” The meaning of the dictate in our verse therefore is:

Leviticus 19:2,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah,,2.0,False,,,,Shemot Rabbah 43:5,Lv,19,2,"AND MOSES BESOUGHT THE LORD HIS GOD (32, 11).  R. Tanhuma b. Abba began thus: Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn back His wrath (ps. 106.23).  R. Hama b. Hanina said: The good advocate knows how to present his case clearly before the tribunal.  Moses was one of the two advocates that arose to defend Israel and set themselves, as it were against the Holy One, blessed be He.  These were Moes and Daniel.  That Moses was one we deduce from: ‘Had not Moses His chosen, etc.,’ and that Daniel was the other we infer from: And I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer, etc. (Dan IX, 3).  These were the two men who set their face against the Attribute of strict Justice in order to plead for mercy on Israel’s behalf.  "

R. Shimeon b. Lakish said: Moses gave us in writing in the Torah two verses whose meaning we can infer from the wicked Pharaoh. One verse says, “[YHVH will make you the head, not the tail;] you will only be at the top [and never at the bottom—if only you obey and faithfully observe the commandments of YHVH your God that I enjoin upon you this day]” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.28.13"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 28:13"">Deut. 28:13</a>). Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states “only”, a limiting term: My greatness is higher than yours. We can infer this from the wicked Pharaoh. It says, “You (Joseph) shall be in charge of my court, [and by your command shall all my people be directed]” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.41.40"" data-ref=""Genesis 41:40"">Gen. 41:40</a>). Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states “only with respect to the throne shall I be superior to you” (ibid.): My rank shall be greater than yours. Consider our verse too: “You shall be holy”. Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states, “for holy am I, YHVH your God” (ibid.): My holiness is higher than yours. And this also we can learn from the wicked Pharaoh; for it says, “Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘I am Pharaoh’” (ibid. vs. 44): Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states, “I am Pharaoh”: My rank shall be higher than yours.

Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus,commentary,11.0,True,,,,Ramban on Leviticus 17:11:1,Lv,17,11,"FOR THE LIFE OF THE FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD; AND I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU UPON THE ALTAR TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SOULS. The sense of this verse is to state that He forbade us [to eat] blood because He has given it to us to be upon the altar and to effect atonement for our souls, and it is therefore the part dedicated to G-d, just as is the case with the forbidden fat.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">184</sup><i class=""footnote"">Above, 3:17.</i> And if one should ask: “Why then has He forbidden us to eat the blood of a wild animal and that of a fowl, from which offerings are not brought?” We will dismiss the questioner by saying that it was His wish to keep us far away from eating any kind of blood, in order that we should never make a mistake therein [and eat forbidden blood as a result of failing to distinguish between one kind of blood and another]. In the case of fat, however, He did not [categorically] forbid all kinds of fat, because [the permissible kind of fat] is distinguishable from the non-permissible.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">185</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Ramban above, 3:9, that even in the same animal the prohibited fat is distinguishable from the permitted fat. So also are the fats of a permitted fowl and wild beast [which are permitted to be eaten] distinguishable from those fats of a permitted animal that may not be eaten. This is not so in the case of blood; hence He prohibited all blood, even that of fowls and wild animals which are not offered upon the altar.</i><br>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">186</sup><i class=""footnote"">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 46.</i> that the Chaldeans loathed blood, considering it impure, and only those who sought to establish contact with the demons and to foretell the future would eat it. Now the Torah always seeks to destroy these foolish theories, by [ordaining measures which are] contrary to their ideas. Therefore He prohibited the eating of blood and chose it as the means of purifying [the impure] by means of the sprinklings thereof,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">187</sup><i class=""footnote"">Such as in the case of the leper (above, 14:14).</i> and to throw it upon the altar of G-d for atonement. Therefore He said, <i>I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">188</sup><i class=""footnote"">Above, Verse 10.</i> just as He said with reference to him who gives of his children to Molech,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">189</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, 20:6: <i>And I will set My face against that soul</i>.</i> because this [practice of eating blood] leads to a kind of idol worship, such words not being stated concerning any other commandment. Now these words [of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] are sensible in themselves, however the verses do not indicate [that the reason for the prohibition against eating blood is] so [as the Rabbi has said], for they always state the reason for that prohibition to be, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof;</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, Verse 14.</i> <i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">191</sup><i class=""footnote"">In Verse 11 before us.</i> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He again states, <i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i><br>It is proper, therefore, to explain the reason for the prohibition against eating blood by saying that G-d created all lower creatures for the purpose of man, since only he amongst all of them recognizes his Creator. Nonetheless, He did not at first permit man to eat anything except for vegetation, but no living creatures at all, just as is stated in the Chapter of Creation where it is said, <i>Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed</i> etc. <i>for food</i>;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">193</sup><i class=""footnote"">Genesis 1:29. See Ramban there (Vol. I, pp. 57-58) for a full exposition of the thought presented here briefly.</i> but when the flood came and they [the lower creatures] were saved by the merit of Noah, and he brought offerings from them to G-d which were acceptable before Him,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">194</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:21.</i> He gave man permission to slaughter [and eat them], just as He said, <i>Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">195</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:3.</i> since their existence was because of man. Thus He permitted man to use their bodies for his benefit and needs because their life was on account of man’s sake, and that their soul [i.e., blood] should be used for man’s atonement when offering them up before Him, blessed be He, but not to eat it, since one creature possessed of a soul is not to eat another creature with a soul, for all souls belong to G-d. The life of man just as the life of the animal are all His, <i>even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">196</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ecclesiastes 3:19.</i><br>Now in the opinion of the Greek philosopher [i.e., Aristotle] as interpreted by those who scrutinize his words, it was out of the Active Intellect<sup class=""footnote-marker"">197</sup><i class=""footnote"">A concept of great significance in Medieval philosophy, the Active Intellect denoted an incorporeal substance, the role of which was to make the forms of the imagination “actual” objects of the intellect, after they have been only “potential” objects of the intellect. Yehudah Halevi in his “Al Khazari,” when presenting the view of the philosophers, writes of it: “This is the degree of the Active Intellect, namely, that angel whose degree is below the angel who is connected with the sphere of the moon” (p. 37). It is out of that Active Intellect that the animal soul originated.</i> that there emitted a very fine and bright flash and glitter of light, from which came forth the spark which is the soul of the animal. It is thus in a certain sense a real soul. It therefore has sufficient understanding to avoid harm, and to seek its welfare, and a sense of recognition towards those with whom it is familiar, and love towards them, just as dogs love their masters, and they have a wonderful sense of recognition of the people of their households, and similarly pigeons have a sense of knowledge and recognition. Now it is also known that the food one eats is taken into the body of the eater <i>and they become one flesh</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">198</sup><i class=""footnote"">Genesis 2:24.</i> If one were to eat <i>the life of all flesh</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, Verse 14.</i> it would then attach itself to one’s own blood and they would become united in one’s heart, and the result would be a thickening and coarsensss of the human soul so that it would closely approach the nature of the animal soul which resided in that which he ate, since blood does not require digestion as other foods do, which thereby become changed, and thus man’s soul will become combined with the blood of the animal! And Scripture states, <i>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">199</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ecclesiastes 3:21.</i> It is for this reason that He said, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the flesh thereof</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, Verse 14.</i> for all flesh, whether man or beast, has its soul in the blood, and it is not fitting to mix the soul that is destined to destruction with that which is to live [in the hereafter]. Rather, it is to be as an atonement upon the altar to be acceptable before G-d. This is the sense of the expression, <i>Therefore I said to the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">200</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 12.</i> meaning: “Because the blood is identical with the soul, and it is not proper that one soul devour another, therefore I had compassion upon man’s life and gave it [the animal’s soul] to him upon the altar, so that the soul of the animal should effect atonement for his soul.” Thus we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">201</sup><i class=""footnote"">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 76.</i> “<i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> Rabbi Yehudah says, [From the fact that it states, <i>only be steadfast</i>, which indicates that a special effort was required], you learn that they were addicted to eating blood etc. <i>For the blood is the life</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this teaches you why it was prohibited. <i>And thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this prohibits the eating of a limb cut from a living animal.” This is a hint and proof for what we have explained. It is for this reason that He further commanded that we are to cover up all blood of an [edible] wild beast or fowl [which have been ritually slaughtered]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">202</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 13.</i> because their blood is not brought upon the altar, for even of fowls only two species [i.e., young pigeons and turtle doves] may be brought as offerings, and they too are not slaughtered [in the usual way];<sup class=""footnote-marker"">203</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above, 1:15.</i> but in the case of cattle, most of them that are found among men may be slaughtered to the Glorious Name and their blood is used for atonement, and it is therefore not to be covered. There was no necessity to require the covering of the blood of an ordinary [unconsecrated] animal, since the slaughtering of cattle for ordinary meat was not permitted in the desert,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">204</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Ramban above, Verse 2.</i> and even afterwards [when Israel came into the Land of Israel and a meal of ordinary meat was permitted], the commandment of the Torah is directed to the majority [and since in most cases cattle were brought as offerings, and their blood would be needed for the altar, therefore He did not require covering of the blood even if the cattle were not slaughtered as offerings]."

Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus,commentary,11.0,True,,,,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 17:11:1,Lv,17,11,"<b> <span class=""font1"">כי נפש הבשר בדם היא</span>, for the life-force of all flesh is in its blood;</b> why is the fact that the life-force is in the blood repeated twice in this verse? According to what I have written earlier this verse explains why the soul of the person eating blood is destroyed. The reason is that the blood contains the <span class=""font1"">נפש</span>, the essence of the animal it comes from. Consuming that life-force results in the soul- i.e. life-force of the person who consumed it becoming diluted with this spiritually inferior life-force. We still need to investigate why the Torah chose the expression <span class=""font1"">נפש הבשר</span>, ""life-force of the flesh,"" instead of writing ""the life-force is within the blood?"" I believe G'd was anxious to answer a potential questioner that if the imbibing of the animal is so detrimental to the soul of a Jew, why did He not forbid the consumption of the flesh (meat) also? After all, the flesh too contained the life-force of the animal so that eating it would also cause irreparable harm to a Jewish soul? The Torah therefore repeats that it is only <b>the blood</b> in the flesh which contains the essence of the animal not the flesh itself. The essence of the animal is found in its blood, and not in the flesh. This is the meaning of <span class=""font1"">נפש הבשר בדם היא</span>. G'd did not make a human being in such a fashion. In the case of man, the life-force is not only in the blood but also in the flesh and the bones. Our sages refer to this life-force as <span class=""font1"">הבלה</span>, a certain moisture which survives in the bones of the righteous for many years after they have died. This is why they do not rot away. On the other hand, the wicked who are compared to animals are those who will not be resurrected when the time comes seeing that all their bones have dried out and have rotted away completely so that not an iota of their one-time life-force still exists."
Leviticus 17:11,Midrash,Sifra,,11.0,True,,,,"Sifra, Vayikra Dibbura d'Nedavah, Chapter 4 9",Lv,17,11,"1) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.3-4"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:3-4"">Vayikra 1:3-4</a>): ""… before the L–rd. And he shall place (his hand on the head of the olah""): There is no semichah on a bamah (a temporary altar, it not being considered "" before the L–rd""). (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:11"">Vayikra 1:11</a>): (""And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar) northward (tzafonah), before the L–rd"": There is no tzafon (requirement) on a bamah. Now which measure is greater? That of tzafon or that of semichah? The measure of tzafon is greater. For tzafon obtains both with individual and with communal offerings, whereas semichah obtains only with individual offerings. If I exclude them (bamoth) from tzafon, the greater measure, would I not exclude them from semichah, the lesser measure? (Why, then, is the exclusion verse for bamoth re semichah necessary) Perceived thus, tzafon is the greater measure, and semichah, the lesser. But perceived otherwise, semichah is the greater measure and tzafon the lesser. For semichah obtains with both higher and lower-order offerings, whereas tzafon obtains only with higher-order offerings. If I exclude them (bamoth) from tzafon, the lesser measure, I would not exclude them from semichah, the greater measure. So that because there obtains with tzafon what does not obtain with semichah, and with semichah, what does not obtain with tzafon; it is, therefore, written: ""before the L–rd, vesamach"" — there is no semichah on a bamah. ""tzafonah before the L–rd"" — there is no tzafon on a bamah. ""before the L–rd vesamach"": Even if he performed semichah outside (the azarah), he must return and perform it inside (""before the L–rd"")."
Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,11.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Leviticus 17:11:1",Lv,17,11," כי נפש כל בשר בדם הוא, “for every living creature’s life-force is in its blood.” From this we learn that the reason for our not being allowed to eat blood is that the purpose of the blood is to secure atonement for man. It is part of the essence of the creature. The reason is the same as the reason for the prohibition of eating certain fat parts that are burned up on the altar. These too serve to secure man atonement for his sins. For man to eat such parts of the animal would be counterproductive, as he would deprive himself of the chance to achieve atonement This leaves us with the question why the blood and fat of animals which are not allowed to be offered on the altar is also forbidden? Also, why then did the Torah not forbid all kinds of fat, not only that on the kidneys and the liver? The fat parts that are not easily identifiable from a distance have not been designated as atonement to be burned up on the altar. Seeing that all blood looks alike, no such distinction was made as to which part of the blood requires sprinkling on the altar, etc. Maimonides’ approach to the subject parallels that of Nachmanides, i.e the Torah widens the framework of the prohibition to make such practices as sacrificing to the demons even more unlikely. Ibn Ezra points out that the resident stranger has not been mentioned in this paragraph at all, as opposed to the paragraph dealing with meat offerings and burnt offerings, as the Israelites in the Land of Israel are obligated to enforce that such resident strangers do not offer sacrifices to their deities. On the other hand, when discussing the prohibition of eating blood, the stranger resident in the Land of Israel is mentioned as, seeing that the blood represents the life force of the animal, such a stranger is also forbidden to eat that blood.

Leviticus 17:11,Midrash,Midrash Tanchuma,,11.0,True,,,,"Midrash Tanchuma, Tzav 14:1",Lv,17,11,"Another interpretation: ""Command Aharon [...]"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.6.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 6:2"">Leviticus 6:2</a>) This is what is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.20"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:20"">Psalms 51:20</a>), ""With Your will, do good to Zion,"" and afterwards (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.21"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:21"">Psalms 51:21</a>), ""Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering.""  That is to say, if Israel does not offer a burnt-offering before the Holy One, blessed be He, Zion and Jerusalem will not be built. As they are only built through the merit of the burnt-offering which Israel would offer before the Holy One, blessed be He. And why is the burnt-offering different, [so that it is] better than all of the other offerings? Because it is called ""sacrifices of righteousness,"" as it is stated, ""Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, ""On account of this,  the burnt-offering is so beloved to Me. Hence, 'Command Aharon and his sons,' that they be careful with it, to offer it before Me."" Why does it state, ""This is the law (Torah) of the burnt-offering?"" It means to say, the reading of the Torah. See how beloved the reading of the Torah is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. As there is an obligation upon a man to give all of his money to teach Torah to himself and his sons, as it is stated, ""Command Aharon and his sons, saying"" - meaning, that they should say it to the Children of Israel, such that they occupy themselves with the reading of the burnt-offering. As even though they [actually] offer a burnt-offering, they would [also] be occupied with its reading, so that they would get merit in the sacrifice and in its reading. And so did Rav Shmuel bar Abba say, ""The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, 'Even though the Temple is destined to be destroyed in the future and the sacrifices to be nullified, do not [allow] yourselves to forget the order of the sacrifices; but rather be careful to read about them and review them. And if you occupy yourselves with them, I will count it for you as if you were occupied with the sacrifices [themselves].'"" And if you want to know [that this is so], come and see that when the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Yechezkel the form of the [Temple], what did He say? ""Describe the [Temple] to the House of Israel; let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and measure the plan"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.43.10"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 43:10"">Ezekiel 43:10</a>). Yehezkel [responded] to the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Until now, we are put into exile in the land of our enemies; and You say to me to go and inform Israel [about] the form of the [Temple], and 'write [it] in their eyes, and they should preserve its form and all of its statutes [and do them]' (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.43.11"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 43:11"">Ezekiel 43:11</a>). And are they able to do [them]? Leave them until they emerge from the exile, and afterwards, I will go and tell them."" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Yechezkel, ""And because My children are in exile, the building of My [Temple] should be idle?"" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ""Its reading in the Torah is as great as its building. Go and say it to them, and they will occupy themselves to read the form of the [Temple] in the Torah. And in reward for its reading, that they occupy themselves to read about it, I count it for them as if they were occupied with the building of the [Temple]."" And fortunate is the man who involves himself in Torah and gives his money to teach Torah to his son. As on account of the money that he gives to teach, he merits life in the world to come, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.30.20"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 30:20"">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>), ""as it is your life and the length of your days"" - your life, in the world to come; and length of your days, in the world that is long. And know that it is so. Rabbi Assia said, ""Why do the infants of the master's schoolhouse begin by studying the book of Leviticus? Rather it is because all the sacrifices are written in it; and because [the infants] are pure until now and do not know what is the taste of sin and iniquity. Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Let them begin first with the order of the sacrifices - let  the pure ones come and occupy themselves with the acts of purification. Hence I count it for them as if they were standing and offering sacrifices in front of Me.' And He is informing you that even though the Temple is destroyed and sacrifices are not practiced, were it not for the infants that read the order of the sacrifices, the world would not stand."" Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, ""My children, even thought the Temple is destroyed and the sacrifices are annulled and the sacrifice of the burnt-offering is not practiced, if you occupy yourselves and read the section of the burnt-offering and study the section about sacrifices, I count it for you as if you are offering a sacrifice of a burnt-offering in front of Me, as it is stated, 'This is the Torah of a burnt-offering'"" - meaning to say, one who occupies himself with the Torah of the burnt-offering merits life in the world to come. What is written above? ""A soul that sins and violates a violation of the Lord, and denies against his kinsman, etc."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.5.21"" data-ref=""Leviticus 5:21"">Leviticus 5:21</a>); and afterwards, ""This is the law of the burnt-offering."" Isaiah said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.61.8"" data-ref=""Isaiah 61:8"">Isaiah 61:8</a>), ""Since I the Lord love justice, hate theft in a burnt-offering."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ""Do not say, 'I will steal and extort, and [then I will] bring a burnt-offering and it will atone for me.' As I hate theft, even with a burnt-offering made for the theft. And if the world wants that I should accept a burnt-offering, return the theft to its master; and afterwards, if he bring up a burnt-offering for it, I will accept it, as it is stated, 'Since I the Lord [...] hate theft in a burnt-offering' - hate the burnt-offering when the theft is still in his hand."" And one who reads the Torah of the burnt-offering is as if he brings up and offers a burnt-offering in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And therefore, fortunate is the one teaches himself Torah and gives his money to teach himself and his sons, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:11"">Leviticus 7:11</a>), ""This is the law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings"" (here read as ""This is the Torah of the sacrifice of payments""). Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Master of the world, behold You command us that we bring all of these sacrifices. When the Temple was still in existence, a man that sins brings a sacrifice and it is atoned for him. And so [too], he brings a meal-offering and it is accepted for him. But now that the Temple was destroyed, what can we do about our sins and about our guilt?"" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, ""If you want that they should be atoned for you, keep My laws, and I will count it for you as if you did a sacrifice in front of Me."" And from where [do we know this]? ""This is the law (Torah) for the burnt-offering, for the meal-offering, for the sin-offering, for the guilt-offering, for the induction-offerings and for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.37"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:37"">Leviticus 7:37</a>) - do not read it so, but rather, ""This is the Torah; not for the burnt-offering, not for the meal-offering, not for the sin-offering, not for the guilt-offering, not for the induction-offerings and not for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings."" Rather, occupy yourselves with Torah, and it will be considered in front of Me, as if you offered all of the sacrifices in front of Me.  Hence, David stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.119.97"" data-ref=""Psalms 119:97"">Psalms 119:97</a>), ""How much have I loved Your Torah, it is my speech all of the day."" Since I know that occupation with Your Torah atones for iniquities - therefore I have loved Your Torah. What is [the understanding of] ""upon its burning on the altar all of the night"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.6.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 6:2"">Leviticus 6:2</a>)? This is that they would burn the fats and the limbs the whole entire night, and the prayers were instituted corresponding to the sacrifices. Now that we do not have burnt-offerings, nor sacrifices, nor meal-offerings, nor guilt offerings, they instituted them as prayers. And the evening prayer can be brought the whole night, just as we bring limbs and fats the whole entire night. But the forefathers instituted the prayers, and this means to say, its burning is on the altar all of the night. And why was the burning on the altar and not in another place? Rather the verse states (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:21"">Exodus 20:21</a>), ""Make an altar of earth (<i>adamah</i>) for Me"" - why of earth? Because man (Adam) was created from the earth, and his name was called Adam, because he was taken from the <i>adamah</i>. And we bring up burnt-offerings and sacrifices on that altar which is made of earth to atone for the body that is taken from the earth. And from where [do we know] that it atones for the soul? As it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.17.14"" data-ref=""Leviticus 17:14"">Leviticus 17:14</a>), ""As the soul of all flesh, its blood is in its soul."" And it also states (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.17.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 17:11"">Leviticus 17:11</a>), ""as the blood atones for the soul."" ""And they shall throw the blood on the altar"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.5"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:5"">Leviticus 1:5</a>) - meaning to say, they shall throw the blood - which is the soul - upon the altar - which is from earth like the body - and it shall atone for the soul. ""A permanent fire shall burn upon the altar; you shall not extinguish"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.6.6"" data-ref=""Leviticus 6:6"">Leviticus 6:6</a>); but it [also] states (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.24"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:24"">Isaiah 66:24</a>), ""They shall go out and gaze on the corpses of the men who rebelled against Me, their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, etc."" [That is referring to] those that deny the Omnipresent. But the fire that is permanently burning on the altar atones for the sins of Israel. And what is [the understanding of] ""altar"" (<i>mizbeach</i>)? [It is an acronym:] <i>Mem</i> is <i>mechilah</i> (pardon), as it pardons their sins; <i>zayin</i> is <i>zechut</i> (merit), as it gives them merit for the world to come; <i>bet</i> is <i>berakha</i> (blessing), as the Holy One, blessed be He, gives them blessing [through it] in the deeds of their hands; <i>chet</i> is <i>chaim</i> (life), as they merit [through it] to life in the world to come. One who leaves all of these - pardon, merit, blessing and life - and goes and worships idolatry, is burned by His great fire, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.4.24"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 4:24"">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>), ""As the Lord, your God, is a consuming fire, He is a jealous God."" How is He jealous? As it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Hosea.2.22"" data-ref=""Hosea 2:22"">Hosea 2:22</a>), ""And I will betroth you in faith."" [Hence,] just as a husband is jealous about his wife, so too is the Holy One, blessed be He, jealous, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.62.5"" data-ref=""Isaiah 62:5"">Isaiah 62:5</a>), ""and the joy of the groom towards the bride, etc."" One who leaves all these will be burnt by His great fire, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.24"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:24"">Isaiah 66:24</a>), ""as their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, and they will be a disgrace for all flesh."" But if he repents, the fire burning on the altar atones for him and expiates the fire of <i>Geihinnom</i>. Moreover, every one of Israel that is circumcised enters the Garden of Eden, since the Holy One, blessed be He, places His name on the Israelite so that he can enter the Garden of Eden. And what is the name and the seal that He places upon them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> (the Omnipotent): The <i>shin</i> He placed in the nose; the <i>dalet</i> in the hand; and the <i>yod</i> in the circumcision. And therefore at the time that an Israelite goes to his final home, there is an appointed angel in the Garden of Eden who takes every son of Israel that is circumcised and brings him to the Garden of Eden. But those that are not circumcised; even though they have two letters of the name of <i>Shaddai</i> - as they have the <i>shin</i> of the nose and the <i>dalet</i> of the hand - they do not have the <i>yod</i> of <i>Shaddai</i>, [and so, the letters they have form] the expression, <i>sheid</i> (demon), meaning to say that a demon brings him to <i>Geihinnom</i>. And an Israelite who is circumcised but worships idolatry [also] goes to enter the Garden of Eden, but the Holy One, blessed be He, commands the angel, such that he pulls his foreskin and makes his foreskin appear as it it were never circumcised, such that he not enter the Garden of Eden but rather <i>Geihinnom</i>. And circumcision is a great thing and beloved in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And all the creatures of the world - whether people, beasts, animals or crawling things, all of them - fear an Israelite when he is circumcised. And so do you find with Yonah. As he fled from his God on the fifth day. And why did he flee? Rather the first time, [God] sent him to restore the border of Israel. The second time, He sent him to Jerusalem to destroy it; but the Holy One, blessed be He, worked up His great mercies and relented from the bad. And [so] they called him a false prophet. The third time, He sent him to Nineveh to destroy it. Yonah judged the case between him and himself - Yonah said, ""I know that the [other] nations are close to repentance. Now they will repent and the Holy One, blessed be He, will [resultantly] send His rage towards Israel. Moreover, Israel will will call me a false prophet"" (etc. in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Midrash_Tanchuma,_Vayikra.8"" data-ref=""Midrash Tanchuma, Vayikra 8"">Midrash Tanchuma, Vayikra 8</a>). ""And the men feared a great fear"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jonah.1.8"" data-ref=""Jonah 1:8"">Jonah 1:8</a>) - [this] teaches that fear is greater than wisdom and understanding. As one who has wisdom and understanding, but does not have fear is not anything.

Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Siftei Chakhamim,commentary,11.0,True,,,,"Siftei Chakhamim, Leviticus 17:11:1",Lv,17,11,"<b>Depends on the blood.</b> By saying this, Rashi indicates that “flesh” of the verse does not mean actual flesh, but that every creature is called flesh as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.6.12"" data-ref=""Genesis 6:12"">Bereishis 6:12</a>), “For all flesh (כל בשר) had corrupted [its way on the earth].” He also writes “depends” to indicate that the soul is not in the blood, because the soul has no tangibility. One cannot speak of it being anywhere, but only of dependency, that its existence depends on the blood since without blood the soul is gone. He also says “therefore” instead of saying “And I have given it to you” like the verse, so that the verse is saying: Because the soul depends on the blood, therefore I have given the blood to achieve atonement for the soul of a person. Thus the verse is not saying “And I have given...” as a separate statement. It seems that the verse uses the expression “flesh” to exclude fish and locusts that are not flesh, and [therefore], when Rashi says “every creature,” this is because a soul cannot rest on any flesh that is not [of] a creature, because there is no soul without life, and no life except [in] a creature.

Ezekiel 34:12,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah,,12,True,,,,Bamidbar Rabbah 16:25,Ez,34,12,"1 A legal teaching: Is it permitted to set sail on the Great Sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) three days before the Sabbath? Our masters taught (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.19a"" data-ref=""Shabbat 19a"">Shab. 19a</a>): One does not set sail in a ship on the Great Sea three days before the Sabbath, when one wants to go to a distant place. If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go [there] while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for [carrying out] a commandment, it is permitted for [such a] one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for [carrying out] a commandment, and an agent for [carrying out] a commandment overrides the Sabbath. And so you find with reference to the sukkah that they have taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 2:4), “Agents for [carrying out] a religious duty are exempted from [the requirements of] the sukkah.”<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Suk.</i> 25a (bar).</i> You have none so dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, as an agent, when he is sent to carry out a religious duty and is risking his life to succeed in it. And you have none who were sent to carry out a religious duty and who risked their lives to succeed in their mission like those two whom Joshua ben Nun sent. Thus it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.2.1"" data-ref=""Joshua 2:1"">Josh. 2:1</a>), “Then Joshua ben Nun sent two [spies] from Shittim [secretly, saying]….” Who were they? Our masters have taught, “These were Phinehas and Caleb.” They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of secretly (<i>heresh</i>)? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried, “Here are pots. Whoever wants [some], let him come and buy.” [Their ruse was] so that no one would notice them. [Hence secretly (<i>heresh</i>) is written [in this verse,] but read it [as] clay (<i>heres</i>), (from which pots are made). [They had made themselves out to be potters] lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.) “So they went and came to the house of a woman who was a harlot whose name was Rahab […]”: She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to investigate the whole land, as stated (in vs. 2), “But it was told the king of Jericho [….].” When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>), as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Malachi.2.7"" data-ref=""Malachi 2:7"">Mal. 2:7</a>), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, and they seek Torah from his mouth, because he is a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord of hosts.” Now an angel desiring [to be visible] is visible; and one desiring [to be invisible] is not visible. And from where is it known that the prophets are also comparable to angels. As so is it stated about Moses (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.20.16"" data-ref=""Numbers 20:16"">Numb. 20:16</a>), “and he sent a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) who brought us out of Egypt.” And was it an angel? And was he not Moses? Hence the prophets are likened to angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>). And so too is it stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.2.1"" data-ref=""Judges 2:1"">Jud. 2:1</a>), “An angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, ‘I brought you up from Egypt…” And was he not Phinehas? It is simply that from here [it is shown] that the prophets are called angels. Hence Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and I do not need to hide. Hide my colleague, Caleb, and I will stand in front of them but they will not see me.” And so did she do, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.2.4"" data-ref=""Joshua 2:4"">Josh. 2:4</a>), “So the woman took the two men [and hid <i>him</i>].” It does not say, “hid them,” but rather “hid him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Him</i> is a literal translation of the Masoretic text.</i>” Behold that she did not hide Phinehas, but rather [only] Caleb. [This is] to teach you how much these two righteous men risked themselves to fulfill their mission. But the agents whom Moses sent were wicked. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.13.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 13:2"">Numb. 13:2</a>) “Send men.”"

In regard to strength, because he was powerful in strength. Come and consider Aaron. When he waved the Levites (as in a wave offering), he waved twenty-two thousand in one day. How did he wave them? Back and forth, up and down. Ergo, he was highest in strength. With regard to wealth, where would it come from? If he was not wealthy, his brother high priests would magnify (rt.: <i>gdl</i>) him. There is a story about Phineas the Stonecutter. When they appointed him high priest, his brother priests went out and saw him cutting stone. So they filled the quarry before him with gold dinars.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">25</sup><i class=""footnote"">Lat.: <i>denarii.</i></i> And where is it shown that if he had nothing, his brother high priests would magnify (rt.: <i>gdl</i>) him?

Your servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them.” Saul said to him, “And who told you that you could slay him?” Immediately David replied, (vs. 37), “The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” Immediately (we read in vs. 38), “Saul clothed David with his military garments.” Now it is written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.9.2"" data-ref=""I Samuel 9:2"">I Sam. 9:2</a>), “he was a head taller<sup class=""footnote-marker"">26</sup><i class=""footnote"">More literally: TALLER FROM HIS SHOULDERS ON UP.</i> than any of the people.” When he had clothed him in his garments and seen that they were fit for him, he immediately cast a jaundiced eye at him.

In regard to strength, because he was heroic in strength. Come and consider Aaron. When he waved the Levites (as in a wave offering), he waved twenty-two thousand in one day. How did he wave them? Back and forth, up and down. Ergo: He was highest in strength. Also in regard to wealth, because if he had not been wealthy, his brother priests would have made him wealthy. There is a story about Pinhas the Stone Cutter. When they appointed him high priest, his brother priests went out and saw him cutting stone.

Here you learn that even though a person may be short, when he is appointed king, he becomes tall. Why? Because as soon as he is anointed with the anointing oil, he becomes superior to his brothers.

Some suggest that the midrash is highlighting, based on the verse in Kings, that gold and spices are items associated with royalty and greatness. Therefore, the reference to spices in the verse in Song of Songs can refer to the guardian angels of the nations, which represent their ultimate level of power and greatness.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥonya [said] regarding the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The Holy One blessed be He does not exact retribution from a nation below until He humbles its guardian angels above. There are five verses in this regard. One, as it is written: “It will be on that day that the Lord will reckon with the host of the heavens in Heaven” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.24.21"" data-ref=""Isaiah 24:21"">Isaiah 24:21</a>), and thereafter “with the kings of the earth” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.24.21"" data-ref=""Isaiah 24:21"">Isaiah 24:21</a>). Two, “how have you fallen from the heavens, shining morning star” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.14.12"" data-ref=""Isaiah 14:12"">Isaiah 14:12</a>), and thereafter, “you have been felled to the ground” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.14.12"" data-ref=""Isaiah 14:12"">Isaiah 14:12</a>). Three, “For my sword has been sated in the heavens” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.34.5"" data-ref=""Isaiah 34:5"">Isaiah 34:5</a>), and thereafter, “it shall descend upon Edom” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.34.5"" data-ref=""Isaiah 34:5"">Isaiah 34:5</a>). Four, “to bind their kings with fetters” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.149.8"" data-ref=""Psalms 149:8"">Psalms 149:8</a>), and thereafter, “and their nobles with iron chains” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.149.8"" data-ref=""Psalms 149:8"">Psalms 149:8</a>). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “To bind their kings with fetters” – these are the guardian angels above, “and their nobles with iron chains,” these are the rulers below. Five, “to execute judgment as it is written” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.149.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 149:9"">Psalms 149:9</a>), and thereafter, “this is glory for all His devoted ones, Halleluya” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.149.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 149:9"">Psalms 149:9</a>).<br>The greatness of Israel is likened to four matters: to the grain harvest, to the grape harvest, to spices, and to a birthing mother. To the grain harvest: When a field is reaped before its time, even its straw is no good, but at its time, it is good. That is what is written: “Extend the scythe, as the harvest is ripe” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joel.4.13"" data-ref=""Joel 4:13"">Joel 4:13</a>). It is likened to the grape harvest: When a vineyard is harvested before its time, even its vinegar is no good, but at its time, it is good. So too, “sing about it, a vineyard of wine” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.27.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 27:2"">Isaiah 27:2</a>) – when the vineyard becomes [ready to produce] wine, pluck it. It is likened to spices: Just as spices that are harvested when they are soft and moist, their fragrance does not diffuse; but when they are dry and are then harvested, their fragrance diffuses. It is likened to a birthing mother: When a woman gives birth before her time, the offspring does not survive. When she gives birth at her time, it lives. Thus, it is written: “Therefore, He will give them up until the time that the birthing mother gives birth” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Micah.5.2"" data-ref=""Micah 5:2"">Micah 5:2</a>). Rabbi Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: “I am the Lord, at its time I will hasten it” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.60.22"" data-ref=""Isaiah 60:22"">Isaiah 60:22</a>) – if you do not merit, at its time. If you merit, I will hasten it.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">67</sup><i class=""footnote"">Redemption will come by a particular time, but if Israel merits, it will come sooner.</i> So may it be His will, speedily in our days, amen."

So here is the Holy One, blessed be He, testifying concerning him after his death (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.34.10"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 34:10"">Deut. 34:10</a>), “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses.” Still, he did not have the power to save himself from death, all the more so other people.

Even an animal that belongs completely to an Egyptian and has one hoof that belongs to a Jew, [Moshe] will not leave. ""Since from them shall we take"" (Ibid.) - after he said, ""from them shall we take,"" he went back and said ""and we do not know with what we will serve the Lord."" He said to him, ""If with you, who are flesh and blood, [and] people die if they transgress your commands; [nonetheless] if you put out a proclamation in front of you and you say, collect this and that for me, the world can stand in front of you [and fulfill your proclamation]; but with us, perhaps God will say to us, 'sacrifice a sacrifice [that includes all of the sacrifices] of two hundred and ten years.'""

(Ibid. 28)"" Moshe said [back] to him, ""you have spoken well; 'I will not see your face again.'"" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ""What is still required for me? To inform Pharaoh of one plague."" Immediately, He went into the palace of Pharaoh for Moshe - who said to [Pharaoh], ""I will not see your face again"" - so that he would not be found to be a fabricator. And you find that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not speak with Moshe in the house of Pharaoh except for that time. From where [do we know this]?

He begin to cry out in public (Ibid. 4), ""'so did the Lord say, ""at the middle of the night.""' You have spoken well, 'I will not see your face again.' I, myself, will not come again to you, but rather you will come to me; and your general that is standing with you - and he is your head officer - and all of these [in] your palace retinue will come to me with you and request of me - and bow down to me - that we should leave from here;"" as it is written (Ibid. 8), ""And all of your servants will come down to me and bow down to me saying"" - he did not want to say, 'and you will bow down to me' because of the honor of the king. When the middle of the night arrived, as Moshe said; immediately, ""And it was the middle of the night and the Lord smote every firstborn."" Hence, ""He fulfills the word of his servant. And completes the counsel of His messengers"" - that He made a counsel (agreement) with Avraham because of this thing. When? When the kings came and he pursued them. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ""It is enough for you until the middle of the night - come, let us split the night, you and I;"" as it is stated, ""And he divided against them at night (understood here as 'and He divided the night for them')."" When the time came, he completed his counsel. That is [the meaning of] ""And it was in the middle of the night."" Thus is it written,  ""And completes the counsel of His messengers."" "

In other words, when some one steals wheat and sows it, should the seed not bear fruit because it has been stolen?

In order to teach you, that anyone who refrains from disciplining his son in the end causes him to fall into evil ways and will hate him.  This is what we have found with Yishmael, who behaved wickedly on Avraham his father but did not rebuke him, with the result that he fell into evil ways and he hated him and he left from his house with nothing.

(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.13.24"" data-ref=""Proverbs 13:24"">Proverbs 13:24</a>) <i> ""But he who loves him disciplines him in his youth"" </i> refers to the Holy Blessed One, who loves Israel, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Malachi.1.2"" data-ref=""Malachi 1:2"">Malachi 1:2</a>) <i> ""I have loved you, says God,"" </i> who increases their suffering.

Exodus 1:11,Commentary,Ramban on Exodus,commentary,11.0,True,,,,Ramban on Exodus 1:11:1,Ex,1,11,"SAREI MISIM’ (OFFICERS OF THE TRIBUTE) TO AFFLICT THEM. Pharaoh imposed a tribute upon the Israelite people to take men from them for the king’s projects. He appointed Egyptian officers over the tribute to take men at will in turns to serve for a month or more in the royal building-projects and the rest of the days [they remained] at home. These officers commanded the Israelites to build cities for Pharaoh, and the people built storage-cities for Pharaoh through this levy. When the Egyptians saw that this forced labor did not harm the Israelites, they were in dread for their own lives<sup class=""footnote-marker"">44</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 12.</i> on account of them. They decreed that all Egyptians force the Israelites to serve them,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">45</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 13.</i> so that any Egyptian who needed work done had the authority to take from them men to do his work. This is the meaning of the verse, <i>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">45</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 13.</i><br>They furthermore decreed against them that they do hard work <i>in mortar and in brick</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">46</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 14.

It is necessary to recall the full text: <i>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor. And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor</i> (Verses 13-14). Ramban understands the term “Egyptians” here as referring to the whole population. Further in the text, Ramban will suggest another interpretation.</i> Whereas at first the officers would give them the bricks and the men of the forced labor would erect the buildings, they now conscripted the entire Israelite people into the work, commanding them to bring the earth, make the mortar with their hands and feet while only the straw was given to them from the king’s house, and give the bricks to the men of the forced labor engaged in the construction of the buildings. Every other manner of hard service in the field for Pharaoh and the Egyptians — such as excavations and the removal of dung — were all imposed upon them. In addition, they subjugated them, pressing them not to rest while beating and cursing them. This is the sense of the expression, <i>in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">46</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 14.

This was not an act of wisdom! Besides, why did the Jews appear to have accepted this procedure without protest? Why did the people who were famed for employing their brains suddenly become bricklayers? The sages in <i>Sotah</i> 11 describe the enslavement of the Jewish population as having occurred progressively; they were sweet-talked into volunteering their services for patritotic reasons until they suddenly found their labour not only as being taken for granted but they could not withdraw it from their superiors. This whole process must have started somewhow. We must assume therefore that before appointing taskmasters, the Egyptians appealed to the Israelites to demonstrate patriotism in return for all the good the Egyptians had done for them during the previous century."

Exodus 1:11,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,11.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Exodus 1:11:1",Ex,1,11," שרי מסים, “taskmasters;” Jewish officials who would select men from among their people whom they considered as fit to perform hard physical labour at the command of the King. In turn, Pharaoh appointed officials of his own to supervise the activities of these Jewish taskmasters. The taskmasters would designate what precisely these servants were to do and where, in this case that they were to build fortified cities by means of laying the bricks for the buildings involved. When the Egyptian overseers became aware that this stratagem did not slow down the birth rate of the Israelites, they decreed that Egyptians generally were allowed to impose all kinds of menial labour on Israelites whom they chose for that purpose. This is why the Torah speaks of the Egyptians generally enslaving the Israelites, i.e.ויעבידו מצרים את בני ישראל בפרך, “the Egyptians (man in the street) enslaved the Israelites imposing harsh conditions.” They added a new element to the hardship by not only making the Israelites build with bricks supplied by them, but by expecting them to also make the bricks themselves. An additional hardship imposed was that they were made to perform labour in the fields, something the Israelites had not been trained to do. This was not constructive work such as sowing and planting, but digging canals, reservoirs, etc. The Torah emphasizes that the conditions under which all these tasks were performed were quite intolerable, and the food supplied by the king for these labourers was minimal and unappetizing. We can understand how ungrateful the Israelites who had been redeemed from such conditions must have been when they longingly looked back on that period in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.11.5"" data-ref=""Numbers 11:5"">Numbers 11,5</a> implying that the only redeeming feature of the fish that Pharaoh had supplied had been that they did not have to catch the fish or pay for them. Similarly, gourds, melons, garlic and other low ranking produce they had been able to help themselves to as their staple diet in the fields in which they had been made to work.
    Our sages view the word לפרעה, “for Pharaoh,” in our verse as meaning that they consoled themselves by being slaves of Pharaoh, instead of slaves of Pharaoh’s slaves. If so, we must understand the line ויעבידו מצרים את בני ישראל as referring back to the phrase וישימו עליו שרי מסים, “they imposed taskmasters upon them.”

Rabbi Moses ben Amram Ha-Parsi<sup class=""footnote-marker"">184</sup><i class=""footnote"">A Karaite commentator on the Bible.</i> says that the obligation to offer a lamb only pertains to the Passover brought in Egypt. However, in the Land of Israel one could sacrifice a lamb or a bull. He offers as proof, <i>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd</i> (Deut. 16:2), which applies to the Passover to be offered in all future generations. However, he did speak correctly. All future Passover offerings are in memory of the paschal lamb offered in Egypt, and one should not deviate from it. The meaning of the aforementioned verse can only be: <i>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God of the flock</i> as an obligation; <i>and of the herd</i>, bring peace offerings to be eaten cooked in water. Similarly, <i>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter</i> (Deut. 16:14) means thou art obligated;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">185</sup><i class=""footnote"">To come to the temple on a pilgrimage and rejoice before the Lord.</i> thy son and thy daughter are permitted to do so.

Scripture then gives the number of burnt offerings as <i>kevasim bene shanah shenem asar</i> (he-lambs of the first year twelve). We thus see that the terms <i>ben shanah</i> and <i>ben shenato</i> are one and the same. Therefore Rabbi Joshua is incorrect. I might add that both Krinsky and Weiser missed I.E.’s point. Both indicate that I.E.’s proof is from the five he-lambs of the first year (<i>bene shanah</i>) brought as peace offerings. However, there is no proof from the latter because the peace offering differs from the burnt offering, and one can argue that Scripture required a lamb under a year for a burnt offering and a lamb over a year for a peace offering.</i>"

From (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.12.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 12:6"">Shemot 12:6</a>) ""and the whole congregation of Israel shall slaughter it (the Paschal lamb),"" I might think, either on a weekday or on Sabbath (as the case may be). And how would I satisfy (Ibid. 31:14) ""Its (Sabbath's) desecrators shall be put to death""? With other labors, other than slaughtering the Paschal lamb. — Or, even with slaughtering the Paschal lamb. And how would I satisfy ""and they shall slaughter it""? (If it falls out) on other days, other than Sabbath. It is, therefore, written ""And the children of Israel shall offer the Pesach in its appointed time"" (— even on the Sabbath). These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan (to R. Yoshiyah): This is not sufficient (for the derivation [i.e., ""in its appointed time"" may mean if it does not fall out on a Sabbath.]) R. Yoshiyah (to R. Yonathan): Rather, it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.28.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 28:2"">Bamidbar 28:2</a>) ""Command the children of Israel and say to them … to offer (the tamid) offering to Me in its appointed time."" If (the intent of this is) to teach that the tamid offering overrides Sabbath, this is not needed; for it is already written (Ibid. 9) ""And on the Sabbath day, (there are to be sacrificed) two lambs of the first year … (10) the burnt-offering of the Sabbath in its Sabbath in addition to the daily burnt-offering, etc."" What, then, is the intent (of ""in its appointed time"")? It is ""extra,"" to signal the formulation of an identity, viz.: it is written here ""in its appointed time,"" and elsewhere (re the Paschal lamb) ""in its appointed time."" Just as ""its appointed time"" here overrides Sabbath, so, ""its appointed time"" there overrides Sabbath. ""On the fourteenth day of this month, towards evening shall you offer it, in its appointed time."": What is the intent of this? Is it not already written ""The children of Israel shall offer it in its appointed time""? Why, again, ""in its appointed time""? Scripture hereby comes to teach us that just as the first Pesach (as opposed to Pesach Sheni) overrides the Sabbath, so it overrides (communal) uncleanliness. For (without this verse,) it would follow otherwise, viz.: If (the slaughtering of) the red heifer, which does not override the Sabbath overrides (communal) uncleanliness, the first Pesach, which overrides the Sabbath, how much more so should it override uncleanliness? — This is refuted by the second Pesach, which even though it overrides the Sabbath, does not override uncleanliness. And this would indicate of the first Pesach that even though it overrides the Sabbath, it does not override uncleanliness. It is, therefore, written ""in its appointed time,"" to teach concerning the first Pesach that just as it overrides the Sabbath it overrides uncleanliness. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) ""According to all of its statutes"": These are the mitzvoth (directly) pertaining to its body, viz. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.12.5"" data-ref=""Exodus 12:5"">Shemot 12:5</a>) ""an unblemished lamb, a male, of the first year.""

""or on a distant way"": This is something that he did not ask. ""if he be unclean by a dead body."" This tells me only of one who is tamei by a dead body. Whence do I derive (the same [i.e., that Pesach Sheni is observed] for) other types of tumah? From ""or if he were on a distant way."" You induce (binyan av) from both, viz.: ""tamei by a dead body"" is not like ""distant way,"" and ""distant way"" is not like ""tamei by a dead body."" What is common to both is that one who did not observe the first Pesach observes Pesach Sheni — So, all who could not observe the first Pesach observe Pesach Sheni. ""on a distant way"": I do not know what constitutes ""a distant way."" R. Akiva says: It is written ""tamei by a dead body"" and ""distant way."" Just as in the fist instance, he desired to observe but could not, so, in the second, he desired to observe but could not; and the sages delimited (""distant way"" as applying to) anyone who at the time of the slaughtering of the Paschal lamb was at a distance from Modi'im (fifteen miles from Jerusalem) and beyond, along the entire circumference. R. Eliezer says ""distant way"" is stated in respect to the tithe (viz. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.14.24"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 14:24"">Devarim 14:24</a>), and ""distant way"" is stated in respect to Pesach. Just as ""distant way"" in respect to the tithe connotes outside the place where it is eaten, so, ""distant way"" in respect to Pesach. Which is the place where it is eaten? From the entrance of Jerusalem within. R. Yehudah says: ""distant way"" is stated in respect to Pesach, and ""distant way"" is stated in respect to the tithe. Just as ""distant way"" in respect to Pesach connotes outside the place of its (the Paschal lamb's) fitness, (i.e., the azarah [the Temple court]) so, ""distant way"" in respect to the tithe. And what is the place of its fitness? (All of Jerusalem) from the azarah outwards."

Ibid. 15:5]). You say after inheritance and settlement, but perhaps immediately upon their entry to the land. It is, therefore, written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.17.14"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 17:14"">Devarim 17:14</a>) ""When you come to the land that the L-rd your G-d gives to you, and you inherit it and you settle in it, etc."" Since ""comings"" are mentioned in the Torah unqualified, and in one instance (above) it is specified, after inheritance and settlement, so all (""comings"" are understood as) after inheritance and settlement, which teaches us that wherever ""settlings"" is written, after inheritance and settling is understood. These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva queried him: But in respect to Shabbath it is written ""settlings"" (viz. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.23.3"" data-ref=""Leviticus 23:3"">Vayikra 23:3</a>), and it obtains both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of it! R. Yishmael replied: If ""lighter"" mitzvoth obtain both in the land and outside it, how much more so, Shabbath, the ""graver."" And it (""settlings"") comes to teach that in an individual altar (""bamah"") there is no obligation to bring libations. R. Akiva says: Scripture comes to teach us that libations are to be offered on a bamah. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: Why is this (""When you come to the land"") written? For it would follow, since we find that the vessels of the Temple were more than those of the tent of meeting (viz. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.7.27"" data-ref=""I Kings 7:27"">I Kings 7:27</a>), so, the libations of the Temple were more than those of the tent of meeting; it is, therefore, written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:2"">Bamidbar 15:2</a>) ""When you come … (3) and you shall offer, etc."" to teach that even though there were more vessels in the Temple than in the tent of meeting, there were not more libations. (Ibid. 3) ""and you shall offer a fire-offering to the L-rd"": This implies that all that is offered for the fire requires libations, even a meal-offering. It is, therefore, written ""a burnt-offering."" This tells me only of a burnt-offering (that it requires libations). Whence do I derive (the same for) peace-offerings? From ""a sacrifice."" Whence do I derive (the same for) a thank-offering? From ""or a sacrifice."" This would imply (that libations are required) for these as well as for first-born, tithe, Pesach and guilt-offering. It is, therefore, written ""for an expressed vow or as a guilt-offering."" Scripture speaks only of offerings that are brought as vow and gift. — But this would imply that I exclude them (from libations) as well as mandatory festival offerings! — It is, therefore, written ""or in your festivals,"" to include these (as requiring libations). — But this would imply (that libations are required for) burnt-offerings and mandatory peace-offerings that are brought on festivals, and for a mandatory sin-offering that is brought on festivals! — It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 15;8) ""And if you offer a bullock as a burnt-offering or as a sacrifice."" ""Bullock"" was included in the general category (of offerings) and departed from it (for specific mention) to teach about the category, viz.: Just as ""bullock,"" which is brought for vow or gift (requires libations, so, all (offerings) that are brought for vow or gift require libations) — to exclude sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, which are not brought for vow or gift."

He might have been tempted to do so in order to escape the wrath of the Egyptian from whom he had purchased it by saying that he had not taken an Egyptian deity, since surely the Egyptians do not worship blemished animals, nor female animals or overage, weak animals, so that he had not committed blasphemy in their eyes. The Torah spells all this out by writing: “unblemished, male, less than a year old.” The Egyptians would raise the price of these animals when aware that the Israelites would use it in the service of their G-d. The Torah wanted the Jews to pay the price of such animals, although at that stage, they could have simply taken the animal without paying for it, as they no longer were afraid of their former masters. These had realised that they were not able to save their animals from the Israelites as long as these were still in their city.

Deuteronomy 21:23,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,23.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 21:23:1",Dt,21,23," כי קללת אלוקים תלוי. ”for a hanging person is a curse of G’d.” Some sages learn from this verse that all people who were executed by stoning are to have their bodies hung publicly during the balance of the day of their execution. The expression קללת אלוקים does not refer to the act of hanging and displaying the body of the sinner in question, but it refers only to the person who was executed for blaspheming. In practice, this hanging is applied only to the body of the blasphemer who, more than anyone else, had cheapened the whole concept of a human being, whom G’d had created in His image, and he had the unforgivable nerve to curse his Creator. His body, by his own admission then, is not worth treating with the dignity accorded to other dead bodies.
    Nachmanides writes that when viewing the text at its face value, the meaning is that whenever a person commits a sin deserving of the death penalty by public hanging, his corpse will not be hung from a tree as there is no greater curse that can be applied to a human being than to publicly hang him. It is therefore not appropriate that such a stain on human dignity, akin to ritual contamination, should ever be seen in the Holy Land.
    Our sages interpret the words קללת אלוקים as referring to the person executed, saying that the message is that although this person deserves the debasement of being hung, but that seeing that this would reflect negatively on his Creator, the Torah spared him this indignity. They also say that we learn from the words קללת אלוקים that anyone hanging a dead corpse thereby inflicting an indignity on that body, is guilty of transgressing a negative commandment (compare <i>Sanhedrin</i> 15)

He explains, “It is an affront, etc.” This [answer] is according to what our Rabbis (i.e. R. Eliezer, Sanhedrin ibid.) expound, “All those who are stoned are also hung.” However, according to the sages who say that the ones who are stoned are not hung except for the blasphemer and the idolater, who is also similar to the blasphemer, you have to say that when it is written כי קללת אלהים, it means “(For) the one who curses Hashem (is hung),” and קללת is an expression of cursing. [If so, why does Rashi not explain the verse according to the sages whose opinion is accepted as halacha?] The reason is that] by explaining the verse according to the Midrash [that says that each <i>parsha is connected to the one adjacent to it] brings it closer to the plain meaning [of the verses], and the juxtaposition of the sections indicates that all those who are stoned are also hung, Rashi therefore explains [like R. Eliezer] that קללת is an expression of “affront.” (See <i>Re”m who discusses this at length). Another answer [that the word קללת means both “affront” and also “curse,”] is that otherwise you might ask, from where does Rashi know that all those who are stoned are also hung if he [later] explains that קללת is an expression of an affront [and not an expression of “curse.” How then does he know that the verse is talking about someone who incurred stoning for cursing?]. [The answer is] that one must to say that [קללת] implies both [curse and an affront], because if it means only to “bless” the Name, it should have said, “(For he who) blesses Hashem,” [which is] a “clean” expression. Therefore [this indicates that] קללת is an expression denoting an affront. And, if it was an expression denoting only an affront, it should have said explicitly an expression denoting an affront. Therefore [we must say that] it is also coming [to be understood] as blessing Hashem. (I found [this interpretation]) </i></i>"

The reason for this is so that people will not confuse this corpse with the one of a blasphemer whose body is to be displayed by hanging, and people might believe that the corpse they are looking at is that of a blasphemer. It would be considered as an insult to a mortal king if too much publicity would be given to someone who had mutinied against him even if he had already been punished for his crime. Similarly, it would be an insult to the immortal King, our Creator, if too much publicity were to be given to someone who had been audacious enough to insult the Creator through blasphemy. An alternate interpretation for the line: כי קללת אלוקים תלוי, people seeing the corpse of someone who had been executed for violating G-d’s commands would reason that the guilty party had already paid the price for what he had done; why subject him to indignities by displaying his body?A third interpretation for the above line: this line is addressed to the judges; people seeing the face of the corpse hanging, and knowing the judges who decreed the corpse’s execution might curse them for having executed him for a minor crime, or for not looking for a technicality to avoid having to convict that person of a capital crime."
Deuteronomy 21:23,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah,,23.0,True,,,,Bamidbar Rabbah 8:4,Dt,21,23,"Man or woman, who does any of the sins etc. - Rabi Abahu says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Hosea.14.8"" data-ref=""Hosea 14:8"">Hosea 14:8</a>): 'Those that dwell under His shadow' those are the gerim that come and have love for the shadow of the Holy One of Blessing. 'They shall grow as grain' in [the study of] Talmud. 'Shall blossom as vine' in [the study of] Aggadah. 'His memory/scent shall be as the wine of Lebanon' - said the Holy One of Blessing: ""The appreciation of the gerim is as dear to me as the wine that was poured on the altar [as libation.]"" And why does He call it [the altar] Lebanon (root LVN)? Because it whitens (maLViN) the sins of Israel like snow, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.1.18"" data-ref=""Isaiah 1:18"">Isaiah 1:18</a>) 'though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.'

As it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.48.2"" data-ref=""Psalms 48:2"">Psalms 48:2</a>): 'Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth.' And the rabbis say - because of the verse (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.9.3"" data-ref=""II Kings 9:3"">II Kings 9:3</a>) 'and My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.' Another interpretation: 'they will grow as grain' - they will make the essence, they are like Israel; as it is said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zechariah.9.17"" data-ref=""Zechariah 9:17"">Zechariah 9:17</a>) 'grain [for] the young men [of Israel]'.

You find that regarding this it is written 'a sin that he sinned' and regarding stealing from a ger it is written 'from any sins of a man.' Regarding this one it is written 'and trespassed a trespass against the Lord' and regarding this one it is written 'to trespass a trespass against the Lord.' Regarding this one it is written: 'And it will be, when he sins and is guilty' and regarding the ger it is written 'and that soul will be guilty'. Regarding this one it is written: 'And he will pay with his head' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will return his guilt with his head'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will add his fifth' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will add a fifth'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will bring his guilt-offering to the Lord' and regarding stealing a ger it is written 'besides the ram for the kipurim'. Behold we have learned: that the essence of the gerim is like Israel's. Therefore, they will be as grain and blossom."

The Torah, reverting to the general terms, כלל, describes Moses calling together the elders who in turn assembled the people at large, telling them משכו וקחו לכם צאן , “draw forth or buy for yourselves a sheep, etc.” It is quite possible that the formulation used was due to the fact that the livestock of the Israelites was quite a distance away from them in the province of Goshen. They were forced to leave their livestock there as sheep, being something repulsive, abominable to the Egyptians, they would not want to antagonize the Egyptians by having their sheep where the Egyptians would see them. The whole paragraph was read to the people, and additional details about what to do with these animals’ blood were added, including the brush to use with which to smear the blood on the doorposts and lintels of their dwellings. They were also warned not to leave their houses during the time that this killing of the firstborn would take place, so as to avoid becoming victims themselves.

Therefore, one who speaks slander is comparable to the dart, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.9.7"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 9:7"">Jer. 9:7</a>), “Their tongue is a sharpened dart; it speaks deceit.” It also says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.57.5"" data-ref=""Psalms 57:5"">Ps. 57:5</a>), “people, whose teeth are spears and darts, and whose tongue a sharp sword.” See how harmful slander is, in that it is more harmful than adultery, shedding blood and idolatry.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">M.

Isaiah 40:8,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah,,8,True,,,,Bamidbar Rabbah 16:3,Is,40,8,"1 A legal teaching: Is it permitted to set sail on the Great Sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) three days before the Sabbath? Our masters taught (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.19a"" data-ref=""Shabbat 19a"">Shab. 19a</a>): One does not set sail in a ship on the Great Sea three days before the Sabbath, when one wants to go to a distant place. If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go [there] while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for [carrying out] a commandment, it is permitted for [such a] one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for [carrying out] a commandment, and an agent for [carrying out] a commandment overrides the Sabbath. And so you find with reference to the sukkah that they have taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 2:4), “Agents for [carrying out] a religious duty are exempted from [the requirements of] the sukkah.”<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Suk.</i> 25a (bar).</i> You have none so dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, as an agent, when he is sent to carry out a religious duty and is risking his life to succeed in it. And you have none who were sent to carry out a religious duty and who risked their lives to succeed in their mission like those two whom Joshua ben Nun sent. Thus it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.2.1"" data-ref=""Joshua 2:1"">Josh. 2:1</a>), “Then Joshua ben Nun sent two [spies] from Shittim [secretly, saying]….” Who were they? Our masters have taught, “These were Phinehas and Caleb.” They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of secretly (<i>heresh</i>)? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried, “Here are pots. Whoever wants [some], let him come and buy.” [Their ruse was] so that no one would notice them. [Hence secretly (<i>heresh</i>) is written [in this verse,] but read it [as] clay (<i>heres</i>), (from which pots are made). [They had made themselves out to be potters] lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.) “So they went and came to the house of a woman who was a harlot whose name was Rahab […]”: She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to investigate the whole land, as stated (in vs. 2), “But it was told the king of Jericho [….].” When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>), as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Malachi.2.7"" data-ref=""Malachi 2:7"">Mal. 2:7</a>), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, and they seek Torah from his mouth, because he is a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord of hosts.” Now an angel desiring [to be visible] is visible; and one desiring [to be invisible] is not visible. And from where is it known that the prophets are also comparable to angels. As so is it stated about Moses (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.20.16"" data-ref=""Numbers 20:16"">Numb. 20:16</a>), “and he sent a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) who brought us out of Egypt.” And was it an angel?

When Israel stood before Mount Sinai, they were not capable of hearing the divinely spoken word, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.22"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:22"">Deut. 5:22</a>), ‘if we continue hearing the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die.’ But Moses was not harmed.” [This is ] in order to teach you that the righteous ones are greater than the ministering angels, since the ministering angels are not able to hear His voice. Rather they stand with excitement and dismay, while the righteous are able to hear His voice. It is so stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joel.2.11"" data-ref=""Joel 2:11"">Joel 2:11</a>), “The Lord shouts aloud before His army, for His host is very great, for mighty is the one who fulfills His word.” “His host” denotes angels, since it is stated (regarding angels in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.32.3"" data-ref=""Genesis 32:3"">Gen. 32:3</a>), “This is God's host.” And so it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Daniel.7.10"" data-ref=""Daniel 7:10"">Dan. 7:10</a>), “thousands upon thousands ministered to Him.” And who is stronger than them? The righteous, of whom it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joel.2.11"" data-ref=""Joel 2:11"">Joel 2:11</a>), “for mighty is the one who fulfills His word,” i.e., a righteous person who does His bidding. And who is this? This is Moses, to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Make a tabernacle.” So he was hurried and made it. Then he stood alone outside, because he was afraid to enter the tent of meeting, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.40.35"" data-ref=""Exodus 40:35"">Exod. 40:35</a>), “Now Moses could not enter the tent of meeting.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “It is not right for Moses, since he made the tabernacle, to stand outside while I stand inside; so look, I am calling upon him to enter.” It is therefore written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.1"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:1"">Lev. 1:1</a>), “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses.” Ergo, greater is the strength of the righteous, in that they are able to hear His voice! So also it is written concerning Samuel (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.3.10"" data-ref=""I Samuel 3:10"">I Sam. 3:10</a>), “Then the Lord came, and stood there, and He called as at other times, ‘Samuel, Samuel’; so Samuel said, ‘Speak, for Your servant is listening.’” Therefore David has said (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.103.20"" data-ref=""Psalms 103:20"">Ps. 103:20</a>), “mighty in strength who fulfill His word.” Now if you say that, when He spoke with Moses, He spoke in a low voice, [and] for that reason he was able to hear, He only spoke in the voice [used in] the giving of Torah. [That was] when they heard His voice and were dying at the first utterance. It is so stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.22"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:22"">Deut. 5:22</a>), “if we continue [hearing the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die].” And so it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.5.6"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 5:6"">Cant. 5:6</a>), “my soul departed when He spoke.” And where is it shown that He spoke with the voice [used in] the giving of Torah? Where it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.29.4"" data-ref=""Psalms 29:4"">Ps. 29:4</a>), “The voice of the Lord has power.” It also says so (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.7.89"" data-ref=""Numbers 7:89"">Numb. 7:89</a>), “When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he would hear the voice speaking unto him,” the voice which he heard in the giving of Torah. He also spoke thus for each and every utterance and for each and every saying, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.29.5"" data-ref=""Psalms 29:5"">Ps. 29:5</a>), “The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars.” Perhaps you will say that Israel heard the voice from outside.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sifra</i> to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.1"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:1"">Lev. 1:1</a>, (2: <i>Wayyiqra</i>, Pereq 2).</i> The text (of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.7.89"" data-ref=""Numbers 7:89"">Numb. 7:89</a>) reads, “he would hear the voice.” He alone heard the voice. But since He spoke in a loud voice, why did they not hear? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, decreed over the utterance, that it would go forth and come to Moses. So the Holy One, blessed be He, made a path for it by which the utterance went forth until it reached Moses, but it was not heard here and there. It is so stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.28.25"" data-ref=""Job 28:25"">Job 28:25</a>), “To fix a weight for the wind.” Thus, when each saying went forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, every one had a [fixed] weight.

[In other words, the Jews had already bound themselves to be obedient to the Torah’s laws even though they had not yet been written down. There is considerable discussion about the term ספר הברית, here whether what was already written in there at the time Moses read from it was subsequently written in the Torah out of context or not. According to our author’s interpretation of the Mechilta when the Israelites said their famous: נעשה ונשמע generally understood as their giving G-d a blank cheque, this was not so, they simply expressed the wish to learn the details of what Moses had already read out to them.

Exodus 24:7,Talmud,Avot D'Rabbi Natan,,7.0,True,,,,Avot D'Rabbi Natan 20:1,Ex,24,7,"Rabbi Hananya, deputy of the priests, would say: Anyone who takes words of Torah to heart is no longer troubled by thoughts of destruction, thoughts of hunger, foolish thoughts, lustful thoughts, thoughts of temptation, thoughts of another man’s wife, thoughts of meaningless things, or thoughts of human burden. So it was written in the book of Psalms by King David (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.19.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 19:9"">Psalms 19:9</a>), “The precepts of the Eternal are true, bringing joy to the heart. The commandments of the Eternal are clear, illuminating the eyes.” But anyone who does not take words of Torah to heart is troubled by thoughts of destruction, thoughts of hunger, foolish thoughts, lustful thoughts, thoughts of temptation, thoughts of another man’s wife, thoughts of meaningless things, and thoughts of human burden. So it was written in Deuteronomy (28:46–48) by Moses our teacher, “They will be a sign and a proof against you and your offspring for all time. Because you would not serve the Eternal your God with joy and gladness over the abundance of everything. You will have to serve, in hunger and in thirst, naked and lacking everything.” “In hunger.” How so? (When a person wishes) to eat even barley bread, but has nothing, and then his enemies come and ask him for wheat bread and fatty meat. “In thirst.” How so? When a person wishes he could drink just a drop of vinegar, or beer, but has nothing, and then his enemies come and ask him for the finest wine in the land. “Naked.” How so? When a person wants to wear a wool or linen shirt, but has nothing, and then his enemies come and ask him for the finest silk in the land. “Lacking everything.” Without a candle, without a knife, and without a table. Another interpretation of “lacking everything”: Without vinegar and without salt. For this is a curse that people often give: May there be no vinegar or salt in your house!<br>He would also say (with regard to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.1.6"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 1:6"">Song of Songs 1:6</a>): “Do not look at me, for I am blackened, scorched by the sun.” These are all the Jewish girls who cast off the yolk of the Holy Blessed One, and accepted human kingship upon themselves.<br>[The verse continues:] “My mother’s children were angry with me.” This is Moses, who killed the Egyptian, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.11-12"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:11-12"">Exodus 2:11–12</a>), “Sometime after that, when Moses had grown older, he went out among his brothers and saw what they were enduring…and he turned this way and that, and saw that there was no one there.” What do we learn from “there was no one there”? This teaches that Moses brought the question before the council of angels who serve God, and asked them: Shall I kill this man? They said to him: Yes, kill him. And did Moses kill him with a sword? No, he killed him with words, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.14"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:14"">Exodus 2:14</a>), “Are you <i>saying</i> you will kill me, just as you killed the Egyptian?” This teaches that Moses killed him by saying the [Ineffable] Name of God.<br>(Another interpretation of) “My mother’s children are angry with me”: this is Moses, who fled to Midian, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.15"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:15"">Exodus 2:15</a>,17), “Pharaoh heard what happened, and sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh. He arrived in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well…And some shepherds came and tried to drive [Jethro’s daughters] away. And Moses got up and saved them, and gave water to their flocks.” Then Moses came and sat among them to render judgment. He said: The general practice in the world is for men to fill the buckets and women to give water to the animals. Here, women draw the water and men give the water to the animals. There is a perversion of justice in this place! (They are guilty by law, and have become guilty through this incident.) Some say that the whole time Moses was standing near the mouth of the well, the water was bubbling up to meet him, and when he left, the water went back down. Then Moses said: Woe is me! For I have left my people and come to live among these heathens.<br>Another interpretation of “My mother’s children are angry with me”: This is Israel, who made the Golden Calf. At first, they said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.24.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 24:7"">Exodus 24:7</a>), “Everything the Eternal has said, we will do and we will understand.” And then they went back and said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.4"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:4"">Exodus 32:4</a>), “These are your gods, Israel!”<br>Another interpretation of “My mother’s children are angry with me”: These are the spies, who slandered the land and caused Israel to die in the desert, as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.14.29"" data-ref=""Numbers 14:29"">Numbers 14:29</a>), “In this desert your carcasses will fall.”<br>“They made me guard the vineyards” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.1.6"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 1:6"">Song of Songs 1:6</a>). The Holy Blessed One said: Who is it that caused Me to favor the heathens? Israel! (For while) the heathens live well, [Israel] are oppressed, scorned, and scattered about.<br>Another interpretation of “They made me guard the vineyards”: This is Israel, who were exiled to Babylon. And prophets rose among them and told them to separate their donations and tithes. The people said to them: We were exiled because we did not separate our donations and tithes, and now you tell us we should separate them?

And while sitting in the door of his tent Abraham lifted up his ‎eyes and behold, three men coming from the distance. And Abraham rose and hastened to ‎meet them, and he bowed down before them and brought them unto his house. And he said ‎unto them: Not so my, lords, but if I have found grace in your eyes, turn ye in and eat a morsel ‎of bread. And after pressing them they turned in and he brought water to wash their feet, and ‎then he seated them under a tree before the door of the tent. And Abraham ran and took a ‎calf tender and good, and he slaughtered it hastily and gave it to his servant Eliezer to do it up. ‎And Abraham came unto the tent to Sarah and said unto her: Take quickly three measures of ‎fine meal, knead it and make cakes to cover up the pots, and she did accordingly. And ‎Abraham brought before them butter and milk and beef and mutton and he placed it before ‎them to eat, ere the other meats were done, and they ate. And when they had finished their ‎eating one of them said: I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and lo, ‎Sarah thy wife will have a son. And after that, the men arose and went their way where they ‎were sent to. And at that time all the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and of all these five ‎cities, were very sinful and wicked before the Lord and they provoked the Lord with all their ‎abominations. And they increased their abominations and acted spitefully against the Lord, ‎and their wickedness grew exceedingly before the eyes of the Lord in those days. And they ‎had in their land a very spacious valley about half a day’s journey, and it was supplied with ‎springs of water and with rich vegetation around the water. And all the people of Sodom and ‎Gomorrah assembled there four days in every year, they and their wives and children and all ‎belonging unto them, and they rejoiced there with music and dancing. And in the midst of ‎their jollification they would rise one and all and take hold upon the wives of their neighbors ‎and their virgin-maidens, and enjoy their company and then they returned them again. And ‎they saw their wives and daughters in the hands of other men, yet they would not say a word. ‎So they carried it on from morning even unto evening, and then they returned every man to ‎his house and every woman to her tent, and that festival lasted four days in each year. And ‎when a stranger came to their city with goods, which he had bought, or if he had some goods ‎for sale, they would gather themselves around him, all the men, women and children, young ‎and old, and they took by force everyone a little of his goods until all of the merchant's ‎property was gone. And when the owner of the merchandise would quarrel with them saying: ‎What mode of dealing is that you have done with me? Then each separately would approach ‎him and show him the little he had in his hand saying: Behold I have not taken of thee but the ‎little which thou hast given unto me. And hearing the same words spoken by every one of ‎them, the poor man would arise and leave in sorrow and bitterness of soul, and then all the ‎people followed him and drove him out of the city midst hooting and yelling. And a certain ‎man was journeying from the land of Elam and he had with him an ass richly caparisoned, and ‎it carried a costly mantle of many colors, and the mantle was fastened with a beautiful cord to ‎the back of the ass. And passing on his way the day darkened over him in Sodom, and he sat ‎down in the street to tarry overnight, for nobody cared to take him into his house. And at that ‎time there was living in Sodom a man especially wicked and cunning to do all things of evil, and ‎his name was Hidod. "

So did our Rabbis teach, ""We inquire about the welfare of the gentiles for the sake of the ways of peace."" R.

Rather they said them on their own."" Our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, ""How many quills are broken, and how much ink is spilled to write these things that were not. And because of what?

Abba said, “There are two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments in the Torah corresponding to the organs that are in a human being; for each and every day they cry out at the person, ‘Perform a commandment with me so that we may live through its merit and you may lengthen your life.’ There are also three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments like the number of the solar days. So on each and every day while the sun rises until it sets, it speaks and cries out at a person, ‘Decree me upon yourself by the One who has brought your days up to this day. Do not commit this transgression against me, and do not tilt yourself and the whole world toward the scale of guilt.’” Here are six hundred and thirteen commandments. Moreover, for each and every commandment there is a recorded reward. For example honoring father and mother (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.12"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:12"">Exod. 20:12</a> // <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.16"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:16"">Deut. 5:16</a>) and leaving a nest alone (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.7"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:7"">Deut. 22:7</a>) about which it is written, a lengthening of life. There are also commandments with children as the reward; as, for example, Sarah, who hosted guests (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.18.6-14"" data-ref=""Genesis 18:6-14"">Gen. 18:6-14</a>), and the Shunammite woman, who received Elisha (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.4.8-17"" data-ref=""II Kings 4:8-17"">II Kings. 4:8-17</a>). There is [also] a transgression, [which may] require stoning, burning, slaying (with the sword),<sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Hereg.</i> See <i>Sanh.</i> 7:3, for the interpretation of <i>hereg</i> as beheading with a sword.</i> or strangulation.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">For details on all four types of execution, see ibid., 6:4; 7:1–3.</i> Of all the commandments, none is as easy as leaving a nest alone. And what it its remuneration (according to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.7"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:7"">Deut. 22:7</a>)? “In order that it may be well with you and you may lengthen your life.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who brought laborers into his field to plant it but did not reveal to them the remuneration for their planting. At evening he gave one gold coin to whoever planted a tree. They all began to be amazed and say, “Now if the one who has only planted a light and small tree [has received] one gold coin, how much the more will there be for us who have planted many [of them].”<sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Devarim_Rabbah.6.2"" data-ref=""Devarim Rabbah 6:2"">Deut. R. 6:2</a>.</i> So if the remuneration for leaving a nest alone has a lengthening of life as its remuneration, how much more will be the remuneration for a commandment in which there is material loss, hardship, and [the need to] preserve one's life? For this reason the Holy One, blessed be He, did not explain the remuneration for the commandments which are in the Torah, so that Israel of its own accord would fulfill them and thereby increase the remuneration. Thus we have learned (in <i>Avot</i> 1:3), “Do not be like servants who serve the master for the sake of receiving a reward […].” It is therefore written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.4.23"" data-ref=""Proverbs 4:23"">Prov. 4:23</a>), “More than any observance preserve your heart, [for out of it comes life].” There is a story about someone who went up to the top of a tree to fulfill the commandment of leaving a nest alone, and he fell and died. [This is] because it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.7"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:7"">Deut. 22:7</a>), “When you come across a bird nest on the way,” and not that you see it at the top of the trees and go up after it. The verse (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.94.12"" data-ref=""Psalms 94:12"">Ps. 94:12</a>) states, “Happy is the man whom You discipline, O Lord, the man You instruct in Your Torah.” Rabbi Elazar ben Yaakov said, “A man must remember gratitude to the Holy One, blessed be He, at a time when afflictions come upon him. Why? Because afflictions draw a man to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.3.12"" data-ref=""Proverbs 3:12"">Prov. 3:12</a>), ‘For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, as a father the son whom he favors.’” R. Shimon bar Yochai said, “If a man’s son dies, he should not voice a complaint, as the son causes him to be acceptable to the Holy One, blessed be He.” There is a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who became angry with the son of his daughter, and someone else came and made this son of his acceptable in front of the king. That son of the daughter says, “Do [I] not need to remember gratitude to the one that made [me] acceptable?” So [too] if a man’s son dies, he should remember gratitude to the Holy One, blessed be He, as the son made the father acceptable to his Creator. Why? (As in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.3.12"" data-ref=""Proverbs 3:12"">Prov. 3:12</a>), “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, [as a father the son whom he favors].” Therefore David said in (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.94.12"" data-ref=""Psalms 94:12"">Ps. 94:12</a>), “Happy is the man whom You discipline, O Lord.” If afflictions come to a person, he should stand firm and accept them. Why? As there is no end to its remuneration. And from where (in Scripture) do you learn [this]? From the tooth and the eye [that is injured], through which a gentile slave goes out to freedom. Is it not [then] fitting that afflictions that scour the entire body of man atone? R. Chiya bar Abba said, “Since it is stated about the one that fulfills the commandment of leaving the nest alone, ‘in order that it may be well with you,’ all the more so will the death of a man’s child atone for him.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.7"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:7"">Deut. 22:7</a>:) “And the young (literally, children) take for yourself.” If you do not have children, I will give you children as the reward for this commandment. Another interpretation of (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.7"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:7"">Deut. 22:7</a>), “You must surely let [the mother] go.” If you let them go, (as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.59.18"" data-ref=""Isaiah 59:18"">Is. 59:18</a>) “According to their deeds, so shall He repay.” [See] what is written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.50.33-34"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 50:33-34"">Jer. 50:33-34</a>), “The children of Israel are oppressed […] they refuse to let them go. Their redeemer is mighty, [His name is] the Lord of hosts; He shall surely fight their fight.” [It also says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.16.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 16:2"">Is. 16:2</a>),] “For it shall be that the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon shall be like a migrating bird, an abandoned nest.” This text is related (to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.17.11"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 17:11"">Jer. 17:11</a>), “As a partridge hatches without laying, so is one who makes money apart from justice….” What is written after that (in vs. 12)? “A glorious throne exalted from the beginning, our sacred shrine.” What is the connection between the two [verses]? Whoever says a partridge hatches is [really] saying a glorious throne. [This is] to teach you that a partridge brings eggs from other birds and sits on them until [the young] emerge from their shells and become fledglings. Then they rise up over it and pluck its wings. When it goes out to fly, it is unable [to do so] because its wings are plucked. So a wild beast or reptile finds it and eats it. And what caused its [destruction]? [It happened] because it had raised eggs that were not its own. So it shall be with the peoples of the world and the Moabites and the Ammonites that stretched their hands against (according to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.17.12"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 17:12"">Jer. 17:12</a>) His glorious throne, destroyed His sacred shrine, burned His Temple, and carried Israel into exile. The Holy One, blessed be He, shall destroy their memory, as the matter is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zephaniah.2.9"" data-ref=""Zephaniah 2:9"">Zeph. 2:9</a>), “Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab shall become like Sodom, [and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah].”"

Genesis 18:12,Commentary,Chizkuni,commentary,12.0,True,,,,"Chizkuni, Genesis 18:12:1",Gn,18,12,"ותצחק שרה, “Sarah laughed;” when the month of Tishrey began, six months after the prediction of the angels, and she had not experienced signs of pregnancy, she abandoned all hope of that prophecy becoming true, as there were only six months left for it to become true. Contrary to her husband Avraham, she had lost faith in the prediction. The reason that Avraham maintained faith in the prediction was that he had heard it from G-d directly, (the angel had spoken to him in the name of the Lord), whereas Sarah, had only been an eavesdropper, and possibly she had not heard correctly. She had assumed that the angels speaking to Avraham had been ordinary human beings. She took a look at her belly and asked mockingly whether such a belly could possibly produce a fetus. As soon as she had done so, in Tishrey, G-d asked Avraham why Sarah had reacted in such a manner, adding that at the time appointed, i.e. when a year had passed at the time of Passover, in the following year, the angel would return and she would have become a mother. In practice this means that the first time she heard the prediction she had heard it from the mouth of an angel whom she had believed to be a mortal human being. The second time Avraham heard it from G-d directly, i.e. 'ויאמר ה, “the Lord said;” this was followed by G-d adding: “Is anything impossible for the Lord to do?”Support for this interpretation can be found seeing that when the angels on the same evening met Lot, Lot offered them unleavened bread, matzot for supper, a hint that the date was the date that would later on become the night of the Seder of the Jewish people.[This is not far fetched at all, as the night when Avraham had fought and secured Lot’s freedom, had been the corresponding date, and Lot therefore had good reason to observe it as an anniversary of great significance for him also.

Rabbi Shimon says, ‘It is not a sanctification of G-d’s Name for the words of the righteous to be effective as long as they live, and then to be removed after their death.’ Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon said, ‘I accept the opinion of Rabbi Yosei rather than that of my father, for it is indeed a sanctification of G-d’s Name for there to be a blessing in the world for the period that the righteous are in the world, and for the blessing to remove from the world when they leave.’” Thus far the text of the Tosephta. Thus the remaining five years of the famine were completed.<br>The opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra is that these two years, [recounted in Verses 14-20, during which the Egyptians gave their money and cattle to Joseph in exchange for food], occurred after Jacob had come to Egypt, [and since there were two years of famine before he came to Egypt, this accounts for four of the seven years of famine]. And Ibn Ezra wrote as follows: “We find in homiletic texts of the Rabbis that the famine was removed by the merit of Jacob. It is also possible that there were three more years of famine, but that they were not as severe as the first four years which had passed.” But Ibn Ezra’s words are not at all correct. The account of the dream and its interpretation make all seven years alike, and, had it been as he said, Scripture would have mentioned the different nature of these three last years.<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan during a period of five years, and he brought it to Pharaoh, for how is it possible for the money and cattle to be exhausted in one year? Rather, the money sufficed them for the entire five years, as is the usual way of the world.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">251</sup><i class=""footnote"">In a time of famine, people conserve money and make it last for a long period of time.</i> Now since nothing was initiated, and no change of any kind occurred during all these years, Scripture relates nothing about them except, <i>And Joseph gathered up all the money</i>, etc.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">252</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 14 here.</i> When the money was exhausted, Scripture relates that they came to Joseph — this was in the sixth year of the famine — and he gave them bread in exchange for their cattle. He fed them with bread only to the extent of sustaining them, but not to satiety. <i>And when that year was ended</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">253</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 18 here.</i> in which he had vowed to them that he would feed them with bread in exchange for their cattle—which was the sixth year—<i>they came unto him the second year</i>, [i.e., the year following the sixth year of famine being discussed], and they told him that he should purchase them and their land for the bread which he will feed them during that seventh year, and since the land will then belong to Pharaoh, he should give them seed so that the land will not be desolate, for they knew that when the seven years of famine will be completed, they will have planting and reaping. The verse stating, <i>And Joseph sustained his father…with bread, according to the want of their little ones</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">246</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 12 here.</i> thus means that he furnished them with bread sufficient for their needs during the famine, as the expression, <i>according to the want of their little ones</i>, indicates."

Genesis 47:18,Commentary,Rashi on Genesis,commentary,18.0,True,,,,Rashi on Genesis 47:18:1,Gn,47,18,בשנה השנית IN THE SECOND YEAR — of the famine.
Genesis 47:18,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,18.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Genesis 47:18:1",Gn,47,18," ויבואו אליו בשנה השנית, “They came to him in the second year, etc.” according to <i>Rashi</i> the verse speaks about the second year of the famine, even though Joseph had spoken about another 5 years of crop failures, (45,11) However, as soon as Yaakov arrived in Egypt, a miracle happened and the blessings returned as a result of his presence.
    Nachmanides writes that although Joseph’s prediction of seven consecutive years of famine did not come true, no one used this as an excuse to call Joseph a liar or a false prophet. The reason was that they noted that the famine continued in the surrounding countries, so that it was clear to them that special circumstances had arisen when Yaakov went down to the Nile and suddenly the waters of the Nile rose to welcome him. Pharaoh himself had witnessed this phenomenon. He showed it to his servants and they realized that Yaakov’s blessing had been effective. We must therefore understand Joseph’s pledge to support his brothers economically as being meant for the normal years to follow, a pledge which was to be valid for at least as long as his father would remain alive. In fact, Joseph continued to support his brothers financially even after his father’s death (50,51) 
    Even considering all this, if all this is true, then Pharaoh’s dream had not been interpreted correctly seeing that Pharaoh had not really been shown the decree nor how it could be changed.
    There is an interesting <i>Tossephta</i> in <i>Sotah</i> according to which Rabbi Yossi said that as soon as Yaakov died, the famine resumed in Egypt. There is also a statement in the S<i>ifri</i> according to which Yaakov’s blessing to Pharaoh consisted in the promise that the famine would cease forthwith. Nonetheless, seeing seven years of famine had been decreed in the dream, these did in fact occur, at intervals, after Yaakov’s death. Rabbi Shimon protested such an interpretation, saying that it does not confer glory on either G’d or His righteous people on earth if the promise (blessing) of a צדיק remains effective only during his own lifetime. In response to this Rabbi Eleazar, son of Rabbi Shimon (ben Yochai) said that he prefers the interpretation of Rabbi Yossi to that of his own father, as it is a greater sanctification of G’d when people observe that as long as a <i>tzaddik</i> walks the earth there is visible blessing on earth thanks to his merit. The very fact that the blessings on earth we due to the presence of <i>Tzaddikim</i> at that time, becomes manifest when these blessings cease as soon as the <i>Tzaddik</i> leaves this earth. The fact is that there are 5 more mentions of famine in Egypt scattered throughout the Bible; these five years of famine completed those predicted by Joseph but interrupted by the blessing of his father Yaakov when he went to see Pharaoh. 
    [by the way, the clue Yaakov had found in Pharaoh’s dream that gave him the opening for this blessing was that the parched ears of corn symbolizing the years of famine, did not grow on a single stalk, whereas the good ears of corn all grew on a single stalk, suggesting that the good years would be consecutive. Ed.] 
    Ibn Ezra claims that here we are speaking about the first 2 years of the famine after Yaakov’s arrival in Egypt. We find support for this in the <i>Midrash</i>, which states that the famine ended thanks to the merit of Yaakov. It is also possible that the division was four years of famine at once, and three years at a later date, but of far less severity.
    Nachmanides writes that he finds these interpretations as unsatisfactory, for if that had been so the Torah herself would have referred to some of these events explicitly.
    At any rate, the meaning of the text read straightforwardly is that Joseph collected all the available money during five years of the famine, but seeing that during those five years no new elements developed, the Torah did not refer to those years individually, but treated them as if they had been a single year. When a new development occurred, i.e. the people for the first time confronting Joseph, the Torah resumes the thread of the narrative. What is related now actually occurred during the sixth year of the famine. At that time Joseph handed out grain and took cattle and beasts of burden as payment for this. When the people came back again in the following year, the second of the last two years, he acquired their land on behalf of Pharaoh and made sharecroppers out of all of them. When he began to hand out seed for sowing it became clear that this had been the last year of the famine.

The food which had been stored up during the seven years of plenty plus the financial savings of the population had sufficed to see them through the first three years. In the fourth year the people tendered their livestock for food, and in the fifth year they tendered their land holdings. In the sixth year they agreed to become slaves of Pharaoh in return for receiving rations from Joseph’s stores. In the seventh year, Joseph gave them seed to plant and they planted it, collecting a harvest in the eight’s year, and the famine was over."

And about which honor did the Torah say (ibid. cont.), “you shall honor the presence of an elder?” That one should not stand in his place or contradict his words. Also when one asks [about] a law (<i>halakhah</i>), one should ask with reverence and not rush to respond or interrupt his words. Whoever does not behave toward his teacher (<i>rav</i>) according to all these rules is labeled a wicked person before the Omnipresent, his learning is forgotten, his years are shortened, and in the end he comes to poverty, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.8.13"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 8:13"">Eccl. 8:13</a>), “It shall not go well with the wicked one, nor shall he prolong his days; [they are] like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.” In regard to this fear I do not know [exactly] what it is; [but] when it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.19.32"" data-ref=""Leviticus 19:32"">Lev. 19:32</a>), “You shall rise in the presence of a gray head, [you shall honor the presence of an elder,] and you shall fear your God,” note that it is [really] saying, this is the fear of [students toward] sages.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">35</sup><i class=""footnote"">Since GRAY HEAD and ELDER are understood to refer to the sages.</i> [But I might say that this is a fear of] usury and of [false] weights, as fear is stated about them [also].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">36</sup><i class=""footnote"">In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.25.36"" data-ref=""Leviticus 25:36"">Lev. 25:36</a>; 19:36.

Eleazar has said, “It is stated here, ‘[you shall honor] the presence (<i>pny</i>) of the elder, and you shall fear your God’; while it is stated in the other passage (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.8.13"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 8:13"">Eccl. 8:13</a>), ‘he is not in fear before (<i>pny</i>) God.’” Hence, one is obligated to greet him before everyone when entering and leaving and to treat him with fear and honor.

R. Abba bar Pappa the Priest said, “When I would see a certain group of people, I would walk by another route so as not to be a bother for them, lest they see me and stand for me. [However] when I told of the matter to R. Jose bar Zevida, he said to me, ‘You must pass before them, so that they will see you and stand in your presence. Then you will bring them to the point of fearing Heaven, as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.19.32"" data-ref=""Leviticus 19:32"">Lev. 19:32</a>), “You shall rise in the presence of a gray head, [you shall honor the presence of an elder,] and you shall fear your God.”’” Why? Because the rise of the righteous is a rise in which there is no decline. But the rise of Esau<sup class=""footnote-marker"">38</sup><i class=""footnote"">Esau stands for any Roman.</i> the wicked is a rise which is wholly decline. Today he is a governor;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">39</sup><i class=""footnote"">Gk.: <i>eparchos.</i></i> tomorrow an assistant [governor]; the next day a captain.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">40</sup><i class=""footnote"">Gk.: <i>stratiotes</i> (“citizen soldier”).</i> And thus it is with all their great ones. So also the prophet says (in Obad. 1:4), “Though you make your abode as high as the eagle, and though [your nest is set] among the stars, I will bring you down from there.” The rise of Jacob, however, is a rise which has no decline, and their holiness is never desecrated.

When he returned to be with the king, the king said to him, “Go with whomever you have toured with, because it not possible for you to walk with me again.” Similarly Balaam had been bound to the holy spirit. When he paired himself with Balak, the holy spirit departed from him. So he returned to being a diviner as in the beginning. Thus it is stated (at his execution in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.13.22"" data-ref=""Joshua 13:22"">Josh. 13:22</a>), “Balaam ben Beor the diviner….” Therefore did he say, “I was high up (<i>ram</i>), and Balak brought me down.” Another interpretation (of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.7"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:7"">Numb. 23:7</a>), “From Aram, Balak the king of Moab has brought me, from the hills of the east.” [Balaam] said to [Balak], “We are alike, even both of us, for being ungrateful, because were it not for our father Abraham, there would have been no Balak. Thus it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.19.29"" data-ref=""Genesis 19:29"">Gen. 19:29</a>), ‘And it came to pass that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot away.’ Except for Abraham, he would not have delivered Lot from Sodom; and you are one of the children of the children of Lot.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">52</sup><i class=""footnote"">As a Moabite, Balak was descended from Moab, the son of Lot.

(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.7"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:7"">Numb. 23:7</a>, cont.:) “Come, curse Jacob for me.” Whoever curses the Children of Jacob is cursing himself, since it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.12.3"" data-ref=""Genesis 12:3"">Gen. 12:3</a>), “and the one who curses you, I will curse.” It also says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.27.29"" data-ref=""Genesis 27:29"">Gen. 27:29</a>), “cursed be those who curse you,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">54</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.6.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 6:16"">Gen. 6:16</a>.</i> and blessed be those who bless you.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.7"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:7"">Numb. 23:7</a>:) “Come, curse [Jacob] for me.” If you had told me to curse another people, for example, the Children of Abraham from the concubines, I would have been able [to do so]. But Jacob? When a king selects a portion for himself, and someone else gets up and speaks disparagingly about it, will he keep his life? Now these people are the Holy One, blessed be He’s, heritage, His portion, and His treasure. Thus it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.9"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:9"">Deut. 32:9</a>), “For the Lord's share is His people; Jacob the portion of His heritage.” And it is written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.19.5"" data-ref=""Exodus 19:5"">Exod. 19:5</a>), “and you shall be My treasure.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.7"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:7"">Numb. 23:7</a>, cont.:) “And come, denounce Israel.” When a king takes a crown and puts it on his head, and someone says of it that it is nothing, will he keep his life? Now in regard to these people it is written about them (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.49.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 49:3"">Is. 49:3</a>), “Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:8"">Numb. 23:8</a>:) “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” When they deserved to be cursed, they were not cursed, when Jacob went in to receive the blessings. It is written (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.27.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 27:16"">Gen. 27:16</a>), “Then [she clothed his arms and the hairless part of his neck] with the skins of goat kids.” His father said to him (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.27.18"" data-ref=""Genesis 27:18"">Gen. 27:18</a>), “Who are you?” He said to him (in vs. 19), “I am Esau, your first-born.” Does not the one who puts forth a lie with his mouth deserve to be cursed? Yet not only [was he not cursed], but he was blessed; as stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.27.33"" data-ref=""Genesis 27:33"">Gen. 27:33</a>), “he shall also be blessed.” So how do I curse them? (In the words of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:8"">Numb. 23:8</a>) “God has not cursed.” Another interpretation (of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:8"">Numb. 23:8</a>), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” According to universal custom, when a legion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">55</sup><i class=""footnote"">Lat.: <i>legio.</i></i> rebels against the king, it incurs the penalty of death. Now since these denied and revolted against Him, when they said to the calf (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.4"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:4"">Exod. 32:4</a>), “This is your God, O Israel,” did they not, therefore, deserve to have Him destroy them at that time? [Still] He did not cease to cherish them. Instead He had clouds of glory accompany them. Nor did He withhold the manna and the well from them. And so it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Nehemiah.9.18-20"" data-ref=""Nehemiah 9:18-20"">Neh. 9:18-20</a>), “Even though they had made themselves a molten calf […], You in Your great mercies did not abandon them in the desert […]; and You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth […].” How can I curse them? This [question] is related (to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:8"">Numb. 23:8</a>), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” When He commanded them concerning the blessings and the curses, He mentioned them (as the people) in connection with the blessings where it is stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.27.12"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 27:12"">Deut. 27:12</a>), “These shall stand [on Mount Gerizim] for blessing the people;” but He did not mention them in connection with the curses. Thus it is stated (in vs. 13), “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse.” Moreover, when they sin and He plans to bring a curse upon them, it is not written that He Himself is bringing them (i.e., the curses); but with respect to the blessings, He Himself is blessing them; for so it says (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.28.1"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 28:1"">Deut. 28:1</a>, 8), “And it shall come to pass that, if you diligently obey […], the Lord your God will set you high [over all the nations of the earth]. The Lord will command the blessing to be with you.” But with respect to the curses, it is written (according to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.28.15"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 28:15"">Deut. 28:15</a>), “And it shall come to pass that, if you do not obey […], then [all these curses] shall come upon you,” [i.e.,] of their own accord. Ergo (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:8"">Numb. 23:8</a>), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.9"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:9"">Numb. 23:9</a>:) “For from the top of the rocks I see him,” in order to make the hatred of that evil man (i.e., Balaam) known to you. As from his blessing you may know his thoughts. To what is he comparable? To someone who came to chop down a tree. One who is not an expert chops off the branches one at a time and becomes tired, but the clever one exposes the roots and [then] chops it down. Similarly that wicked man said, “How shall I curse each and every tribe? Rather I will go to their roots.” When he came to touch them, he found them hard [to cut]. It is therefore stated (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.9"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:9"">Numb. 23:9</a>), “For from the top of the rocks I see him.” Another interpretation (of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.9"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:9"">Numb. 23:9</a>), “For from the top of the rocks,” these are the patriarchs; (ibid., cont.) “and from the hills I behold him,” these are the matriarchs.

And when the Lord will visit you to bring you up from this land into the ‎land of your fathers, then carry ye up my bones with you from here. And Joseph took an oath ‎from the children of Israel, saying: God will surely visit you, and ye shall then carry up my ‎bones from here; and after this Joseph died in that year, the seventy-first year of their going ‎down to Egypt. And Joseph was a hundred and ten years old when he died in the land of ‎Egypt, and all his brothers and all his servants took him and they embalmed Joseph according ‎to their custom, and his brothers and all Egypt wept over him for seventy days. And they ‎placed Joseph into a coffin filled with spices and all kinds of perfumery, and they buried him on ‎the side of the river Thiebor, and his sons and all his brothers, and the entire house hold of his ‎father, made for him a mourning of seven days.‎"

Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus,commentary,11.0,True,,,,Ramban on Leviticus 17:11:1,Lv,17,11,"FOR THE LIFE OF THE FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD; AND I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU UPON THE ALTAR TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SOULS. The sense of this verse is to state that He forbade us [to eat] blood because He has given it to us to be upon the altar and to effect atonement for our souls, and it is therefore the part dedicated to G-d, just as is the case with the forbidden fat.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">184</sup><i class=""footnote"">Above, 3:17.</i> And if one should ask: “Why then has He forbidden us to eat the blood of a wild animal and that of a fowl, from which offerings are not brought?” We will dismiss the questioner by saying that it was His wish to keep us far away from eating any kind of blood, in order that we should never make a mistake therein [and eat forbidden blood as a result of failing to distinguish between one kind of blood and another]. In the case of fat, however, He did not [categorically] forbid all kinds of fat, because [the permissible kind of fat] is distinguishable from the non-permissible.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">185</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Ramban above, 3:9, that even in the same animal the prohibited fat is distinguishable from the permitted fat. So also are the fats of a permitted fowl and wild beast [which are permitted to be eaten] distinguishable from those fats of a permitted animal that may not be eaten. This is not so in the case of blood; hence He prohibited all blood, even that of fowls and wild animals which are not offered upon the altar.</i><br>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">186</sup><i class=""footnote"">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 46.</i> that the Chaldeans loathed blood, considering it impure, and only those who sought to establish contact with the demons and to foretell the future would eat it. Now the Torah always seeks to destroy these foolish theories, by [ordaining measures which are] contrary to their ideas. Therefore He prohibited the eating of blood and chose it as the means of purifying [the impure] by means of the sprinklings thereof,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">187</sup><i class=""footnote"">Such as in the case of the leper (above, 14:14).</i> and to throw it upon the altar of G-d for atonement. Therefore He said, <i>I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">188</sup><i class=""footnote"">Above, Verse 10.</i> just as He said with reference to him who gives of his children to Molech,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">189</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, 20:6: <i>And I will set My face against that soul</i>.</i> because this [practice of eating blood] leads to a kind of idol worship, such words not being stated concerning any other commandment. Now these words [of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] are sensible in themselves, however the verses do not indicate [that the reason for the prohibition against eating blood is] so [as the Rabbi has said], for they always state the reason for that prohibition to be, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof;</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, Verse 14.</i> <i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">191</sup><i class=""footnote"">In Verse 11 before us.</i> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He again states, <i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i><br>It is proper, therefore, to explain the reason for the prohibition against eating blood by saying that G-d created all lower creatures for the purpose of man, since only he amongst all of them recognizes his Creator. Nonetheless, He did not at first permit man to eat anything except for vegetation, but no living creatures at all, just as is stated in the Chapter of Creation where it is said, <i>Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed</i> etc. <i>for food</i>;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">193</sup><i class=""footnote"">Genesis 1:29. See Ramban there (Vol. I, pp. 57-58) for a full exposition of the thought presented here briefly.</i> but when the flood came and they [the lower creatures] were saved by the merit of Noah, and he brought offerings from them to G-d which were acceptable before Him,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">194</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:21.</i> He gave man permission to slaughter [and eat them], just as He said, <i>Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">195</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:3.</i> since their existence was because of man. Thus He permitted man to use their bodies for his benefit and needs because their life was on account of man’s sake, and that their soul [i.e., blood] should be used for man’s atonement when offering them up before Him, blessed be He, but not to eat it, since one creature possessed of a soul is not to eat another creature with a soul, for all souls belong to G-d. The life of man just as the life of the animal are all His, <i>even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">196</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ecclesiastes 3:19.</i><br>Now in the opinion of the Greek philosopher [i.e., Aristotle] as interpreted by those who scrutinize his words, it was out of the Active Intellect<sup class=""footnote-marker"">197</sup><i class=""footnote"">A concept of great significance in Medieval philosophy, the Active Intellect denoted an incorporeal substance, the role of which was to make the forms of the imagination “actual” objects of the intellect, after they have been only “potential” objects of the intellect. Yehudah Halevi in his “Al Khazari,” when presenting the view of the philosophers, writes of it: “This is the degree of the Active Intellect, namely, that angel whose degree is below the angel who is connected with the sphere of the moon” (p. 37). It is out of that Active Intellect that the animal soul originated.</i> that there emitted a very fine and bright flash and glitter of light, from which came forth the spark which is the soul of the animal. It is thus in a certain sense a real soul. It therefore has sufficient understanding to avoid harm, and to seek its welfare, and a sense of recognition towards those with whom it is familiar, and love towards them, just as dogs love their masters, and they have a wonderful sense of recognition of the people of their households, and similarly pigeons have a sense of knowledge and recognition. Now it is also known that the food one eats is taken into the body of the eater <i>and they become one flesh</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">198</sup><i class=""footnote"">Genesis 2:24.</i> If one were to eat <i>the life of all flesh</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, Verse 14.</i> it would then attach itself to one’s own blood and they would become united in one’s heart, and the result would be a thickening and coarsensss of the human soul so that it would closely approach the nature of the animal soul which resided in that which he ate, since blood does not require digestion as other foods do, which thereby become changed, and thus man’s soul will become combined with the blood of the animal! And Scripture states, <i>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">199</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ecclesiastes 3:21.</i> It is for this reason that He said, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the flesh thereof</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">190</sup><i class=""footnote"">Further, Verse 14.</i> for all flesh, whether man or beast, has its soul in the blood, and it is not fitting to mix the soul that is destined to destruction with that which is to live [in the hereafter]. Rather, it is to be as an atonement upon the altar to be acceptable before G-d. This is the sense of the expression, <i>Therefore I said to the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood</i>,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">200</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 12.</i> meaning: “Because the blood is identical with the soul, and it is not proper that one soul devour another, therefore I had compassion upon man’s life and gave it [the animal’s soul] to him upon the altar, so that the soul of the animal should effect atonement for his soul.” Thus we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">201</sup><i class=""footnote"">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 76.</i> “<i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> Rabbi Yehudah says, [From the fact that it states, <i>only be steadfast</i>, which indicates that a special effort was required], you learn that they were addicted to eating blood etc. <i>For the blood is the life</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this teaches you why it was prohibited. <i>And thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">192</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this prohibits the eating of a limb cut from a living animal.” This is a hint and proof for what we have explained. It is for this reason that He further commanded that we are to cover up all blood of an [edible] wild beast or fowl [which have been ritually slaughtered]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">202</sup><i class=""footnote"">Verse 13.</i> because their blood is not brought upon the altar, for even of fowls only two species [i.e., young pigeons and turtle doves] may be brought as offerings, and they too are not slaughtered [in the usual way];<sup class=""footnote-marker"">203</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above, 1:15.</i> but in the case of cattle, most of them that are found among men may be slaughtered to the Glorious Name and their blood is used for atonement, and it is therefore not to be covered. There was no necessity to require the covering of the blood of an ordinary [unconsecrated] animal, since the slaughtering of cattle for ordinary meat was not permitted in the desert,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">204</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Ramban above, Verse 2.</i> and even afterwards [when Israel came into the Land of Israel and a meal of ordinary meat was permitted], the commandment of the Torah is directed to the majority [and since in most cases cattle were brought as offerings, and their blood would be needed for the altar, therefore He did not require covering of the blood even if the cattle were not slaughtered as offerings]."

Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus,commentary,11.0,True,,,,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 17:11:1,Lv,17,11,"<b> <span class=""font1"">כי נפש הבשר בדם היא</span>, for the life-force of all flesh is in its blood;</b> why is the fact that the life-force is in the blood repeated twice in this verse? According to what I have written earlier this verse explains why the soul of the person eating blood is destroyed. The reason is that the blood contains the <span class=""font1"">נפש</span>, the essence of the animal it comes from. Consuming that life-force results in the soul- i.e. life-force of the person who consumed it becoming diluted with this spiritually inferior life-force. We still need to investigate why the Torah chose the expression <span class=""font1"">נפש הבשר</span>, ""life-force of the flesh,"" instead of writing ""the life-force is within the blood?"" I believe G'd was anxious to answer a potential questioner that if the imbibing of the animal is so detrimental to the soul of a Jew, why did He not forbid the consumption of the flesh (meat) also? After all, the flesh too contained the life-force of the animal so that eating it would also cause irreparable harm to a Jewish soul? The Torah therefore repeats that it is only <b>the blood</b> in the flesh which contains the essence of the animal not the flesh itself. The essence of the animal is found in its blood, and not in the flesh. This is the meaning of <span class=""font1"">נפש הבשר בדם היא</span>. G'd did not make a human being in such a fashion. In the case of man, the life-force is not only in the blood but also in the flesh and the bones. Our sages refer to this life-force as <span class=""font1"">הבלה</span>, a certain moisture which survives in the bones of the righteous for many years after they have died. This is why they do not rot away. On the other hand, the wicked who are compared to animals are those who will not be resurrected when the time comes seeing that all their bones have dried out and have rotted away completely so that not an iota of their one-time life-force still exists."
Leviticus 17:11,Midrash,Sifra,,11.0,True,,,,"Sifra, Vayikra Dibbura d'Nedavah, Chapter 4 9",Lv,17,11,"1) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.3-4"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:3-4"">Vayikra 1:3-4</a>): ""… before the L–rd.

(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:11"">Vayikra 1:11</a>): (""And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar) northward (tzafonah), before the L–rd"": There is no tzafon (requirement) on a bamah. Now which measure is greater? That of tzafon or that of semichah? The measure of tzafon is greater. For tzafon obtains both with individual and with communal offerings, whereas semichah obtains only with individual offerings. If I exclude them (bamoth) from tzafon, the greater measure, would I not exclude them from semichah, the lesser measure? (Why, then, is the exclusion verse for bamoth re semichah necessary) Perceived thus, tzafon is the greater measure, and semichah, the lesser. But perceived otherwise, semichah is the greater measure and tzafon the lesser. For semichah obtains with both higher and lower-order offerings, whereas tzafon obtains only with higher-order offerings. If I exclude them (bamoth) from tzafon, the lesser measure, I would not exclude them from semichah, the greater measure. So that because there obtains with tzafon what does not obtain with semichah, and with semichah, what does not obtain with tzafon; it is, therefore, written: ""before the L–rd, vesamach"" — there is no semichah on a bamah. ""tzafonah before the L–rd"" — there is no tzafon on a bamah. ""before the L–rd vesamach"": Even if he performed semichah outside (the azarah), he must return and perform it inside (""before the L–rd"")."
Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,11.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Leviticus 17:11:1",Lv,17,11," כי נפש כל בשר בדם הוא, “for every living creature’s life-force is in its blood.” From this we learn that the reason for our not being allowed to eat blood is that the purpose of the blood is to secure atonement for man. It is part of the essence of the creature. The reason is the same as the reason for the prohibition of eating certain fat parts that are burned up on the altar. These too serve to secure man atonement for his sins. For man to eat such parts of the animal would be counterproductive, as he would deprive himself of the chance to achieve atonement This leaves us with the question why the blood and fat of animals which are not allowed to be offered on the altar is also forbidden? Also, why then did the Torah not forbid all kinds of fat, not only that on the kidneys and the liver? The fat parts that are not easily identifiable from a distance have not been designated as atonement to be burned up on the altar. Seeing that all blood looks alike, no such distinction was made as to which part of the blood requires sprinkling on the altar, etc. Maimonides’ approach to the subject parallels that of Nachmanides, i.e the Torah widens the framework of the prohibition to make such practices as sacrificing to the demons even more unlikely. Ibn Ezra points out that the resident stranger has not been mentioned in this paragraph at all, as opposed to the paragraph dealing with meat offerings and burnt offerings, as the Israelites in the Land of Israel are obligated to enforce that such resident strangers do not offer sacrifices to their deities. On the other hand, when discussing the prohibition of eating blood, the stranger resident in the Land of Israel is mentioned as, seeing that the blood represents the life force of the animal, such a stranger is also forbidden to eat that blood.

Leviticus 17:11,Midrash,Midrash Tanchuma,,11.0,True,,,,"Midrash Tanchuma, Tzav 14:1",Lv,17,11,"Another interpretation: ""Command Aharon [...]"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.6.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 6:2"">Leviticus 6:2</a>) This is what is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.20"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:20"">Psalms 51:20</a>), ""With Your will, do good to Zion,"" and afterwards (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.21"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:21"">Psalms 51:21</a>), ""Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering.""  That is to say, if Israel does not offer a burnt-offering before the Holy One, blessed be He, Zion and Jerusalem will not be built. As they are only built through the merit of the burnt-offering which Israel would offer before the Holy One, blessed be He. And why is the burnt-offering different, [so that it is] better than all of the other offerings? Because it is called ""sacrifices of righteousness,"" as it is stated, ""Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, ""On account of this,  the burnt-offering is so beloved to Me. Hence, 'Command Aharon and his sons,' that they be careful with it, to offer it before Me."" Why does it state, ""This is the law (Torah) of the burnt-offering?"" It means to say, the reading of the Torah. See how beloved the reading of the Torah is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. As there is an obligation upon a man to give all of his money to teach Torah to himself and his sons, as it is stated, ""Command Aharon and his sons, saying"" - meaning, that they should say it to the Children of Israel, such that they occupy themselves with the reading of the burnt-offering. As even though they [actually] offer a burnt-offering, they would [also] be occupied with its reading, so that they would get merit in the sacrifice and in its reading. And so did Rav Shmuel bar Abba say, ""The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, 'Even though the Temple is destined to be destroyed in the future and the sacrifices to be nullified, do not [allow] yourselves to forget the order of the sacrifices; but rather be careful to read about them and review them. And if you occupy yourselves with them, I will count it for you as if you were occupied with the sacrifices [themselves].'"" And if you want to know [that this is so], come and see that when the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Yechezkel the form of the [Temple], what did He say? ""Describe the [Temple] to the House of Israel; let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and measure the plan"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.43.10"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 43:10"">Ezekiel 43:10</a>). Yehezkel [responded] to the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Until now, we are put into exile in the land of our enemies; and You say to me to go and inform Israel [about] the form of the [Temple], and 'write [it] in their eyes, and they should preserve its form and all of its statutes [and do them]' (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.43.11"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 43:11"">Ezekiel 43:11</a>). And are they able to do [them]? Leave them until they emerge from the exile, and afterwards, I will go and tell them."" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Yechezkel, ""And because My children are in exile, the building of My [Temple] should be idle?"" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ""Its reading in the Torah is as great as its building. Go and say it to them, and they will occupy themselves to read the form of the [Temple] in the Torah. And in reward for its reading, that they occupy themselves to read about it, I count it for them as if they were occupied with the building of the [Temple]."" And fortunate is the man who involves himself in Torah and gives his money to teach Torah to his son. As on account of the money that he gives to teach, he merits life in the world to come, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.30.20"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 30:20"">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>), ""as it is your life and the length of your days"" - your life, in the world to come; and length of your days, in the world that is long. And know that it is so. Rabbi Assia said, ""Why do the infants of the master's schoolhouse begin by studying the book of Leviticus? Rather it is because all the sacrifices are written in it; and because [the infants] are pure until now and do not know what is the taste of sin and iniquity. Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Let them begin first with the order of the sacrifices - let  the pure ones come and occupy themselves with the acts of purification. Hence I count it for them as if they were standing and offering sacrifices in front of Me.' And He is informing you that even though the Temple is destroyed and sacrifices are not practiced, were it not for the infants that read the order of the sacrifices, the world would not stand."" Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, ""My children, even thought the Temple is destroyed and the sacrifices are annulled and the sacrifice of the burnt-offering is not practiced, if you occupy yourselves and read the section of the burnt-offering and study the section about sacrifices, I count it for you as if you are offering a sacrifice of a burnt-offering in front of Me, as it is stated, 'This is the Torah of a burnt-offering'"" - meaning to say, one who occupies himself with the Torah of the burnt-offering merits life in the world to come. What is written above? ""A soul that sins and violates a violation of the Lord, and denies against his kinsman, etc."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.5.21"" data-ref=""Leviticus 5:21"">Leviticus 5:21</a>); and afterwards, ""This is the law of the burnt-offering."" Isaiah said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.61.8"" data-ref=""Isaiah 61:8"">Isaiah 61:8</a>), ""Since I the Lord love justice, hate theft in a burnt-offering."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ""Do not say, 'I will steal and extort, and [then I will] bring a burnt-offering and it will atone for me.' As I hate theft, even with a burnt-offering made for the theft. And if the world wants that I should accept a burnt-offering, return the theft to its master; and afterwards, if he bring up a burnt-offering for it, I will accept it, as it is stated, 'Since I the Lord [...] hate theft in a burnt-offering' - hate the burnt-offering when the theft is still in his hand."" And one who reads the Torah of the burnt-offering is as if he brings up and offers a burnt-offering in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And therefore, fortunate is the one teaches himself Torah and gives his money to teach himself and his sons, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:11"">Leviticus 7:11</a>), ""This is the law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings"" (here read as ""This is the Torah of the sacrifice of payments""). Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Master of the world, behold You command us that we bring all of these sacrifices. When the Temple was still in existence, a man that sins brings a sacrifice and it is atoned for him. And so [too], he brings a meal-offering and it is accepted for him. But now that the Temple was destroyed, what can we do about our sins and about our guilt?"" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, ""If you want that they should be atoned for you, keep My laws, and I will count it for you as if you did a sacrifice in front of Me."" And from where [do we know this]? ""This is the law (Torah) for the burnt-offering, for the meal-offering, for the sin-offering, for the guilt-offering, for the induction-offerings and for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.37"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:37"">Leviticus 7:37</a>) - do not read it so, but rather, ""This is the Torah; not for the burnt-offering, not for the meal-offering, not for the sin-offering, not for the guilt-offering, not for the induction-offerings and not for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings."" Rather, occupy yourselves with Torah, and it will be considered in front of Me, as if you offered all of the sacrifices in front of Me.  Hence, David stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.119.97"" data-ref=""Psalms 119:97"">Psalms 119:97</a>), ""How much have I loved Your Torah, it is my speech all of the day."" Since I know that occupation with Your Torah atones for iniquities - therefore I have loved Your Torah. What is [the understanding of] ""upon its burning on the altar all of the night"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.6.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 6:2"">Leviticus 6:2</a>)? This is that they would burn the fats and the limbs the whole entire night, and the prayers were instituted corresponding to the sacrifices. Now that we do not have burnt-offerings, nor sacrifices, nor meal-offerings, nor guilt offerings, they instituted them as prayers. And the evening prayer can be brought the whole night, just as we bring limbs and fats the whole entire night. But the forefathers instituted the prayers, and this means to say, its burning is on the altar all of the night. And why was the burning on the altar and not in another place? Rather the verse states (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:21"">Exodus 20:21</a>), ""Make an altar of earth (<i>adamah</i>) for Me"" - why of earth? Because man (Adam) was created from the earth, and his name was called Adam, because he was taken from the <i>adamah</i>. And we bring up burnt-offerings and sacrifices on that altar which is made of earth to atone for the body that is taken from the earth. And from where [do we know] that it atones for the soul? As it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.17.14"" data-ref=""Leviticus 17:14"">Leviticus 17:14</a>), ""As the soul of all flesh, its blood is in its soul."" And it also states (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.17.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 17:11"">Leviticus 17:11</a>), ""as the blood atones for the soul."" ""And they shall throw the blood on the altar"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.5"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:5"">Leviticus 1:5</a>) - meaning to say, they shall throw the blood - which is the soul - upon the altar - which is from earth like the body - and it shall atone for the soul. ""A permanent fire shall burn upon the altar; you shall not extinguish"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.6.6"" data-ref=""Leviticus 6:6"">Leviticus 6:6</a>); but it [also] states (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.24"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:24"">Isaiah 66:24</a>), ""They shall go out and gaze on the corpses of the men who rebelled against Me, their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, etc."" [That is referring to] those that deny the Omnipresent. But the fire that is permanently burning on the altar atones for the sins of Israel. And what is [the understanding of] ""altar"" (<i>mizbeach</i>)? [It is an acronym:] <i>Mem</i> is <i>mechilah</i> (pardon), as it pardons their sins; <i>zayin</i> is <i>zechut</i> (merit), as it gives them merit for the world to come; <i>bet</i> is <i>berakha</i> (blessing), as the Holy One, blessed be He, gives them blessing [through it] in the deeds of their hands; <i>chet</i> is <i>chaim</i> (life), as they merit [through it] to life in the world to come. One who leaves all of these - pardon, merit, blessing and life - and goes and worships idolatry, is burned by His great fire, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.4.24"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 4:24"">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>), ""As the Lord, your God, is a consuming fire, He is a jealous God."" How is He jealous? As it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Hosea.2.22"" data-ref=""Hosea 2:22"">Hosea 2:22</a>), ""And I will betroth you in faith."" [Hence,] just as a husband is jealous about his wife, so too is the Holy One, blessed be He, jealous, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.62.5"" data-ref=""Isaiah 62:5"">Isaiah 62:5</a>), ""and the joy of the groom towards the bride, etc."" One who leaves all these will be burnt by His great fire, as it is stated (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.24"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:24"">Isaiah 66:24</a>), ""as their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, and they will be a disgrace for all flesh."" But if he repents, the fire burning on the altar atones for him and expiates the fire of <i>Geihinnom</i>. Moreover, every one of Israel that is circumcised enters the Garden of Eden, since the Holy One, blessed be He, places His name on the Israelite so that he can enter the Garden of Eden. And what is the name and the seal that He places upon them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> (the Omnipotent): The <i>shin</i> He placed in the nose; the <i>dalet</i> in the hand; and the <i>yod</i> in the circumcision. And therefore at the time that an Israelite goes to his final home, there is an appointed angel in the Garden of Eden who takes every son of Israel that is circumcised and brings him to the Garden of Eden. But those that are not circumcised; even though they have two letters of the name of <i>Shaddai</i> - as they have the <i>shin</i> of the nose and the <i>dalet</i> of the hand - they do not have the <i>yod</i> of <i>Shaddai</i>, [and so, the letters they have form] the expression, <i>sheid</i> (demon), meaning to say that a demon brings him to <i>Geihinnom</i>. And an Israelite who is circumcised but worships idolatry [also] goes to enter the Garden of Eden, but the Holy One, blessed be He, commands the angel, such that he pulls his foreskin and makes his foreskin appear as it it were never circumcised, such that he not enter the Garden of Eden but rather <i>Geihinnom</i>. And circumcision is a great thing and beloved in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And all the creatures of the world - whether people, beasts, animals or crawling things, all of them - fear an Israelite when he is circumcised. And so do you find with Yonah. As he fled from his God on the fifth day. And why did he flee? Rather the first time, [God] sent him to restore the border of Israel. The second time, He sent him to Jerusalem to destroy it; but the Holy One, blessed be He, worked up His great mercies and relented from the bad. And [so] they called him a false prophet. The third time, He sent him to Nineveh to destroy it. Yonah judged the case between him and himself - Yonah said, ""I know that the [other] nations are close to repentance. Now they will repent and the Holy One, blessed be He, will [resultantly] send His rage towards Israel. Moreover, Israel will will call me a false prophet"" (etc. in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Midrash_Tanchuma,_Vayikra.8"" data-ref=""Midrash Tanchuma, Vayikra 8"">Midrash Tanchuma, Vayikra 8</a>). ""And the men feared a great fear"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jonah.1.8"" data-ref=""Jonah 1:8"">Jonah 1:8</a>) - [this] teaches that fear is greater than wisdom and understanding. As one who has wisdom and understanding, but does not have fear is not anything. As so did King Shlomo, peace be upon him, state (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.12.13"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 12:13"">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>), ""At the end of the matter when all is heard; fear God and observe His commandments, as this is all of man."""
Leviticus 17:11,Commentary,Siftei Chakhamim,commentary,11.0,True,,,,"Siftei Chakhamim, Leviticus 17:11:1",Lv,17,11,"<b>Depends on the blood.</b> By saying this, Rashi indicates that “flesh” of the verse does not mean actual flesh, but that every creature is called flesh as it says (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.6.12"" data-ref=""Genesis 6:12"">Bereishis 6:12</a>), “For all flesh (כל בשר) had corrupted [its way on the earth].” He also writes “depends” to indicate that the soul is not in the blood, because the soul has no tangibility. One cannot speak of it being anywhere, but only of dependency, that its existence depends on the blood since without blood the soul is gone. He also says “therefore” instead of saying “And I have given it to you” like the verse, so that the verse is saying: Because the soul depends on the blood, therefore I have given the blood to achieve atonement for the soul of a person. Thus the verse is not saying “And I have given...” as a separate statement. It seems that the verse uses the expression “flesh” to exclude fish and locusts that are not flesh, and [therefore], when Rashi says “every creature,” this is because a soul cannot rest on any flesh that is not [of] a creature, because there is no soul without life, and no life except [in] a creature.

What does one verse have to do with the other? An analogy: A province rebels against the king, who sends for a general and orders him to devastate it. The general, being wise and seasoned tells them: ""Put together something for me to relay to the king, or I will do to you what I did to this and this province."" This is the intent of ""Shomron shall bear her guilt for she has defied her G-d"" and ""Return, O Israel, etc."""

Leviticus 19:2,Commentary,Sforno on Leviticus,commentary,2.0,True,,,,Sforno on Leviticus 19:2:1,Lv,19,2,"דבר אל כל עדת...קדושים תהיו; after the presence of G’d had manifested itself among the Jewish people, sanctifying them for eternal life, as had been the meaning of the verse in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.19.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 19:6"">Exodus 19,6</a> “you shall become for Me a nation of priests a holy nation,” and taking into consideration G’d’s statement in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.11.45"" data-ref=""Leviticus 11:45"">Leviticus 11,45</a> “I have led you out of the land of Egypt in order to be your G’d and your becoming holy,” G’d had in the meantime separated the Jewish people from impurity through the legislation concerning forbidden foods, skin eczemas, ritual impurity contracted through cohabitation with menstruant women, or women afflicted with excretions from their vaginas at times other than when they were experiencing menstruation.<br> G’d had also elaborated on other ritual contaminations contracted through sinful contact. The objective of all these parts of Torah legislation was to establish a nation that could be described as “holy,” not least of it the legislation concerning incest.<br> At this point, i.e. after achieving this “holiness,” i.e. emulating the Creator’s holiness in the maximum manner possible for creatures, the Torah spells out this objective by saying כי קדוש אני, “For I the Lord am holy;” the message is that the original intention in creating man in the image of G’d (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.26"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:26"">Genesis 1,26</a>) had already had as its declared goal for this “image” to become something constant.

Leviticus 19:2,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus,commentary,2.0,True,,,,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 19:2:1,Lv,19,2,"<b> <span class=""font1"">אל כל עדת בני ישראל</span>, ""to the whole community of the children of Israel.""</b> <i>Torat Kohanim</i> explains why the Torah writes the words ""to all."" Seeing that most of the important commandments of the Torah are contained in this portion Moses addressed them to the whole nation as outlined in <i>Eyruvin</i> 54. Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi describes the logistics of this [seeing they did not have a public address system in those days, Ed.] as distinctly different from other occasions when Moses revealed legislation. Whereas usually the people approached Moses in group after group- ""a group"" meaning a <span class=""font1"">בית אב</span>,- in this instance they all approached simultaneously. This is very difficult. If the Rabbi meant that whereas usually the elders came to Moses first to be followed by the people at large in groups, Moses would have had to repeat the same lecture more than 65 times. According to the <i>Baraitha</i> in <i>Eyruvin</i> 54 Moses taught the same legislation only four times. The Talmud there describes that by the time Moses taught the legislation to the people at large, Aaron had heard it four times, etc. If Rabbi Mizrachi meant by the words ""group after group,"" that Aaron was one group, Nadav and Avihu a second group, and the elders a third group, whereas in this instance the Israelites, the elders, Nadav and Avihu and Aaron all came at the same time, the question is why Moses used a different system when he taught all the other commandments. Why did Moses not teach all of the people these commandments 4 times? Surely if the other commandments warranted that Aaron would hear them 4 times, in this instance it was warranted that all the people hear these commandments 4 times! It would be better if they heard it each time from Moses directly than just once, and the other times only from people who themselves had heard it only from Moses. I believe there are one of two possible reasons for the manner in which Moses normally taught the Torah precepts G'd had revealed to him. 1) He wanted to accord honour to the different levels of spiritual achievements attained by his respective listeners. Accordingly, he would first honour Aaron, then his sons, followed by the elders, and finally the people at large. 2) He wanted to ensure true transmission of his words. Seeing that he taught each group of people separately, when they in turn discussed what they had learned they would be able to compare if each one remembered exactly the same. If the entire people had learned the same lesson from Moses four times in a row, there would not have been any way to compare any discrepancies due to someone's faulty memory. This is something that the listener would be well aware of. It would therefore have been better to follow the pattern of teaching the legislation separately to different groups at different times in this portion also. Why would Moses deprive Aaron of his privileged status when teaching this legislation, or, why would he deprive everyone of the chance to double-check if he heard and remembered correctly? The more important the legislation, the more important that there should be unanimity about exactly what the legislation consisted of! On the other hand, if it was appropriate to teach these commandments to all the people at the same time, why was it not appropriate to have done so with the commandments Moses revealed prior to this occasion? It appears, at least when we look at this superficially, that the Torah's departure from its norm in this case represented a change for the worse!"

Leviticus 19:2,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar,,2.0,True,,,,Sifrei Bamidbar 115:1,Lv,19,2," (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.37-38"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:37-38"">Bamidbar 15:37-38</a>) ""And the L-rd spoke to Moses, saying … and they shall make for themselves tzitzith"": Women, too, are included (in the mitzvah of tzitzith.) R. Shimon exempts women from tzitzith, it being a time-based (only in the daytime) positive commandment, from which women are exempt, this being the principle: R. Shimon said: Women are exempt from all time-based positive commandments. R. Yehudah b. Bava said: Of a certainty, the sages exempted a woman's veil from tzitzith, and they are required in a wrap only because sometimes her husband covers himself with it. ""tzitzith"": ""tzitzith"" is something which ""protrudes"" (""yotzeh"") somewhat. And the elders of Beth Shammai and those of Beth Hillel have already entered the upper chamber of Yonathan b. Betheira and declared: Tzitzith have no prescribed size. And they declared, similarly: A lulav has no prescribed size. ""and they shall make for themselves tzitzith."" I might think that one string suffices; it is, therefore, written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.22.12"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 22:12"">Devarim 22:12</a>) ""Fringes (shall you make for yourself."") How many fringes? Not fewer than three. These are the words of Beth Hillel. Beth Shammai say: Three of wool and the fourth of tcheleth (blue linen). And the halachah is in accordance with Beth Shammai. When is this so (that a minimum size is required)? In the beginning (of its attachment). But for what is left over or lopped off any size (is sufficient). (Bamidbar, Ibid.) ""and they shall make for themselves tzitzith."" I might think that all of it shall be tzitzith; it is, therefore, written ""fringes."" If ""fringes,"" I might think all of it shall be fringes. It is, therefore, written ""tzitzith."" How is this (to be implemented)? That its fringes protrude from the corner (of the garment), and tzitzith from the fringes. ""in the corners of their garments"": I might think, even garments that are three-cornered, five-cornered, six-cornered, seven-cornered, and eight-cornered; it is, therefore, written (Devarim, Ibid.) ""on the four corners of your garment,"" to exclude the aforementioned. And whence is it derived that pillows and covers are (also) excluded (from tzitzith)? From (Ibid.) ""wherewith you cover yourself."" If from there, I would think that night-clothes are also included (as requiring tzitzith). It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) ""and you shall see it"" — in the daytime and not at night. And if it were intended both for day and night, it requires tzitzith. I might think that this excludes both the above and the garment of a blind man; it is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) ""And it shall be for you for tzitzith"" — in any event (i.e., to include a blind man). (Ibid. 38) ""and they shall place on the tzitzith (on) the corner a strand of tcheleth"": spun and doubled. This tells me only of the tcheleth, that it is to be spun and doubled. Whence do I derive (the same for) the white (i.e., the wool)? You derive it by induction, viz.: Since the Torah said: ""place"" tcheleth and ""place"" white, just as tcheleth is spun and doubled, so, white is spun and doubled. ""and they shall place"": on the place of the weaving (i.e., the corner of the garment), and not on the place of the ""growing"" (i.e., the strands at the corner of the garment). If he did place it on the site of the ""growing,"" it is (nonetheless) kasher. R. Eliezer b. Yaakov includes it both on the ""growing"" and on the very edge of the garment, it being written ""on the corners of their garments."" ""and they shall place on the tzitzith (on) the corner"": What is the intent of this? From ""and they shall make for themselves tzitzith, I might think that he should weave it (the tzitzith) together with it (the garment; it is, therefore, written ""and they shall place."" How so? He ties it (the tzitzith) together with it (the garment). (Ibid. 39) ""And it shall be to you for tzitzith"": The four tzitzith are mutually inclusive (i.e., in the absence of one there is no mitzvah), the four being one mitzvah. R. Yishmael says: They are four mitzvoth. R. Elazar b. R. Shimon says: Why is it called ""tcheleth""? Because the Egyptians were ""bereaved"" (""nitkelu"" [like ""tcheleth""]) of their first-born, viz. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.12.29"" data-ref=""Exodus 12:29"">Shemot 12:29</a>) ""And it was in the middle of the night, that the L-rd smote every first-born, etc."" Variantly: Because the Egyptians were ""destroyed"" (""kalu"") in the Red Sea. Why is it called ""tzitzith""? Because the L-rd ""looked"" (""hetzith"") over our fathers' houses in Egypt, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.2.9"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 2:9"">Song of Songs 2:9</a>) ""The voice of My Beloved, behold, it is coming … My Beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart … Behold, He stands behind our wall, looking through the windows, peering through the lattices."" R. Chanina b. Antignos says: One who fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, what is said of him? (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zechariah.8.23"" data-ref=""Zechariah 8:23"">Zechariah 8:23</a>) ""In these days it will happen that ten men, of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the corner (i.e., of the tzitzith) of a Jewish man, saying 'Let us go with you, for we have heard that G-d is with you!'"" And one who nullifies the mitzvah of ""the corner,"" what is said of him? (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.38.13"" data-ref=""Job 38:13"">Iyyov 38:13</a>) ""to take hold of the corners of the earth and to shake the wicked from it!"" R. Meir says: It is not written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) ""And you shall see them"" (the tzitzith), but ""And you shall see Him."" Scripture hereby apprises us that if one fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, it is reckoned unto him as if he beheld the face of the Shechinah. For tcheleth is reminiscent of (the color of) the sea; the sea, of the firmament; and the firmament, of the Throne of Glory, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.1.26"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 1:26"">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) ""And above the firmament that was over their heads … (28) the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the L-rd."" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) ""and you shall see and you shall remember"": See this mitzvah and remember another mitzvah, (which is contingent upon it.) Which is that? The recitation of the Shema — But perhaps (the reference is to) one of all the other mitzvoth of the Torah. It is, therefore, written (in the section of tzitzith, Ibid. 41) ""I am the L-rd your G-d,"" which you find to be written only in (the section of) the recitation of the Shema. ""and you shall remember"": Remember (i.e., recite) the section with your mouth. I might think that the section ""vehaya im shamoa"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.11.13-21"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 11:13-21"">Devarim 11:13-21</a>) should precede all of the sections. — Would you say that? The section of Shema (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.6.4-9"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 6:4-9"">Devarim 6:4-9</a>), which contains acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven should precede ""vehaya im shamoa,"" which contains acceptance of the yoke of mitzvoth, and ""vehaya im shamoa,"" which obtains both in the daytime and at night, should precede the section of tzitzith (""vayomer"" [<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.37-41"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:37-41"">Bamidbar 15:37-41</a>]), which obtains only in the daytime. And perhaps he should recite three (sections) in the evening as he does in the daytime. It is, therefore, written (of tzitzith [<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.39"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:39"">Bamidbar 15:39</a>]) ""and you shall see it"" — in the daytime and not at night. R. Shimon b. Yochai says: The section of Shema, which contains (the mitzvah of) learning (Torah), should precede ""vehaya im shamoa,"" which speaks only of teaching. And ""vehaya im shamoa"" should precede the section of tzitzith, which is only to do (i.e., the final stage). For thus was Torah given: to learn and to teach, to keep and to do: ""And you shall see it, and you shall remember (all the mitzvoth of the L-rd, and you shall do them.""): Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If one who fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, (which is only a sign and a remembrance towards the doing of mitzvoth,) is accounted as one who has fulfilled all of the mitzvoth, how much more so (is this true of) one who (actively) performs (any one of) all the mitzvoth of the Torah! ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts"": This is heresy, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.7.26"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 7:26"">Koheleth 7:26</a>) ""And I find more bitter than death 'the woman' (heresy), whose heart is snares and nets.

""after which you go astray"": This is idolatry, as it is written (Ibid. 8:33) ""and they went astray after the ba'alim."" R. Nathan says: that one not ""drink"" in this ""cup"" (i.e., his own wife), and cast his gaze at the ""cup"" of another. Variantly: ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts and after your eyes"": This teaches us that the eyes follow the heart. — But perhaps the heart follows the eyes! Would you say that? Are there not blind men who commit all the abominations in the world? What, then, is the intent of ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts, etc.""? That the eyes follow the heart. R. Yishmael says: ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts"": What is the intent of this? From (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.11.9"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 11:9"">Koheleth 11:9</a>) ""Rejoice young man in your youth (… and walk in the ways of your heart""), (I would not know whether) in a way that is straight or in (any) way that you like; it is, therefore, written ""And you shall not go astray after your hearts."" (Ibid. 40) ""So that you remember and you do (all of My mitzvoth): This equates remembering with doing. ""and you shall be holy to your G-d"": This refers to the holiness of all of the mitzvoth. You say the holiness of (all the) mitzvoth, but perhaps the holiness of tzitzith (is intended). — Would you say that? What is the (general) context? The holiness of all the mitzvoth. Rebbi says: The reference is to the holiness of tzitzith. You say the holiness of tzitzith, but perhaps the holiness of all the mitzvoth is intended. — (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.19.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 19:2"">Vayikra 19:2</a>) ""Holy shall you be"" already refers to the holiness of all the mitzvoth. How, then, am I to understand ""and you shall be holy to your G-d""? As referring to the holiness of tzitzith — whence it is seen that tzitzith add holiness to Israel. (Ibid. 41) ""I am the L-rd your G-d, who took you out of the land of Egypt."": Why is this mentioned here? So that one not say: I will take imitation-dyed threads (and attach them to my garment) as tcheleth, and who will know the difference? If (within the framework of) the measure of punishment, the lesser measure (of the L-rd) — if one sins in secret, He exposes him in public, (as He did in Egypt), then, (within the framework of) the measure of good, the greater measure (of the L-rd) — how much more so (does this hold true)! Variantly: Why is the exodus from Egypt mentioned in connection with every mitzvah? An analogy: The son of a king's loved one was taken captive. When he (the king) redeems him, he redeems him not as a son, but as a servant, so that if he (the son) does not accept his decree, he can say to him ""You are my servant!"" When they enter the province, he (the king) says to him: Put on my sandals and carry my things before me to the bath-house. The son begins to object, whereupon the king presents him with his writ (of servitude) and says to him: ""You are my servant!"" Thus, when the Holy One Blessed be He redeemed the seed of His loved one, He did not redeem them as ""sons,"" but as servants, so that if they reject His decree He says to them: ""You are My servants!"" When they went to the desert, He began to decree upon them some ""light"" mitzvoth and some formidable ones, such as Shabbath, illicit relations, tzitzith, and tefillin, and Israel began to object — whereupon He said to them: ""You are My servants! On that condition I redeemed you; on condition that I decree and you fulfill!"" ""I am the L-rd your G-d"": Why is this stated again? Is it not already written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.2"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:2"">Shemot 20:2</a>) ""I am the L-rd your G-d who took you out of the land of Egypt""? Why state it again? So that Israel not say: Why did the L-rd command us (to do mitzvoth)? Is it not so that we do them and receive reward? We shall not do them and we shall not receive reward! As Israel said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.20.1"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 20:1"">Ezekiel 20:1</a>) ""There came to me (Ezekiel) men of the elders of Israel to make inquiry of the L-rd, and they sat before me."" They said to him: A servant whose Master has sold him, does he not leave His domain? Ezekiel: Yes. They: Since the L-rd has sold us to the nations, we have left His domain. Ezekiel: A servant whose Master has sold him in order to return, does he leave His domain? (Ibid. 32-33) ""And what enters your minds, it shall not be, your saying: We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, to serve wood and stone. As I live, says the L-rd G-d. I swear to you that I will rule over you with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath!"" ""with a strong hand"": pestilence, as it is written (in that regard, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.9.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 9:3"">Shemot 9:3</a>) ""Behold, the hand of the L-rd is in your cattle, etc."" ""with an outstretched arm"": the sword, as it is written (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Chronicles.21.16"" data-ref=""I Chronicles 21:16"">I Chronicles 21:16</a>) ""with his (the angel's) sword drawn in his hand, stretched over Jerusalem.""

Leviticus 19:2,Commentary,Tur HaArokh,commentary,2.0,True,,,,"Tur HaArokh, Leviticus 19:2:1",Lv,19,2," קדושים תהיו, ”you shall be holy;” Our sages in <i>Torat Kohanim</i> state that this was one of the portions of the Torah which was read out in public once every seven years on <i>Sukkot</i> on the occasion of “<i>hakhel,</i>” the public reading of the Torah by the King before the assembled nation, men women and children (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.31.10"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 31:10"">Deuteronomy 31,10</a>, the penultimate of the 613 commandments). The reason was that it contains so many of the basic laws of the Torah, such as the laws about offering personal voluntary peace-offerings, the penalty for disregarding the laws abut incest and sexual mores. We must understand that holiness can only develop as a result of abstaining from all the items that the Torah has described as an abomination in the eyes of <i>Hashem.</i>
    Nachmanides writes that he has examined the wording in his edition of the <i>Torat</i> Kohanim, and has not found anything spelled out there about being especially פרוש, i.e. keeping one’s distance from the subject covered by sexual mores, but that we are to be generally פרושים, discreet, and discriminating in our conduct, as a result of which holiness will develop. [My edition of the <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, printed in <i>Torah Shleymah</i> bears out what Nachmanides writes. Ed.] G’d is quoted as saying: “just as I keep apart (from contact with what is unbecoming, so shall you keep yourself apart from contact with matters that are unbecoming for you.” It follows that the subject of פרישות includes abstaining and keeping one’s distance from all the subject matter mentioned in the Talmud as subject to such warnings by our sages. 
    Nachmanides uses as an example the fact that whereas on the one hand, the Torah has permitted sexual intercourse, it imposed limitations with whom such sexual intercourse may be indulged in, similarly, it has also permitted the eating of foods which are palatable and non poisonous, but has imposed limitations in forbidding Jews foods which gentiles clearly enjoy without apparent harmful effects. Holiness, if aspired to, is therefore possible by imposing upon oneself restrictions and not considering everything that has not been expressly forbidden as permitted, but to train oneself to be moderate in enjoying the material attractions the world has to offer. These attractions may be enjoyed when they are intended to make the performance of a commandment more meaningful both esthetically and artistically, for instance. A person intent on attaining a level of holiness would not seek out such attractions for their own sake. [When someone loves silver trinkets and collects them, this does not further his path to attaining holiness, although he did not do something forbidden. If, however, he indulges his whim by buying beautiful <i>ethrog</i> boxes, <i>mezuzah</i> housings, <i>kiddush</i> cups, etc., then he may at one and the same time indulge his sense of what is esthetically beautiful, and come closer to attaining degree of holiness.
    Our sages, in limiting the frequency of marital relations with one’s wife even, suggested that a Torah scholar limit himself to such marital intercourse once a week, while an ordinary uneducated worker is allowed to indulge in such activity more often. (Compare <i>Chagigah</i> 18, <i>Berachot,</i> 22 and other places in the Talmud) Nachmanides points out that it is possible not to violate a single one of the 613 commandments in the Torah and still not only to remain far from “holy,” but to continue to be a gross and uncouth individual, eating to excess, drinking to excess, indulging in legally permitted sex at every opportunity, etc.
    If the ideal of a Torah personality could be the result of merely not violating any of the 613 commandments, Moses would not have had to write in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.6.18"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 6:18"">Deut. 6,18</a> ועשית הישר והטוב בעיני ה', “do what is fair and good in the eyes of <i>Hashem.”</i> In<i> halachic</i> parlance, our approach to life should be to act לפנים משורת הדין, “to stay well within what is allowable legally.” The meaning of the dictate in our verse therefore is:

Leviticus 19:2,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah,,2.0,False,,,,Shemot Rabbah 43:5,Lv,19,2,"AND MOSES BESOUGHT THE LORD HIS GOD (32, 11).  R. Tanhuma b. Abba began thus: Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn back His wrath (ps. 106.23).  R. Hama b. Hanina said: The good advocate knows how to present his case clearly before the tribunal.  Moses was one of the two advocates that arose to defend Israel and set themselves, as it were against the Holy One, blessed be He.  These were Moes and Daniel.  That Moses was one we deduce from: ‘Had not Moses His chosen, etc.,’ and that Daniel was the other we infer from: And I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer, etc. (Dan IX, 3).  These were the two men who set their face against the Attribute of strict Justice in order to plead for mercy on Israel’s behalf.  "

R. Shimeon b. Lakish said: Moses gave us in writing in the Torah two verses whose meaning we can infer from the wicked Pharaoh. One verse says, “[YHVH will make you the head, not the tail;] you will only be at the top [and never at the bottom—if only you obey and faithfully observe the commandments of YHVH your God that I enjoin upon you this day]” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.28.13"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 28:13"">Deut. 28:13</a>). Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states “only”, a limiting term: My greatness is higher than yours. We can infer this from the wicked Pharaoh. It says, “You (Joseph) shall be in charge of my court, [and by your command shall all my people be directed]” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.41.40"" data-ref=""Genesis 41:40"">Gen. 41:40</a>). Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states “only with respect to the throne shall I be superior to you” (ibid.): My rank shall be greater than yours. Consider our verse too: “You shall be holy”. Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states, “for holy am I, YHVH your God” (ibid.): My holiness is higher than yours. And this also we can learn from the wicked Pharaoh; for it says, “Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘I am Pharaoh’” (ibid. vs. 44): Could it be that in this you will be like Me? Scripture purposely states, “I am Pharaoh”: My rank shall be higher than yours.
