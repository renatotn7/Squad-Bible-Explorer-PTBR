Ruth,1,1,"It came to pass in the days of the Judge of Judges that there was a great famine in the Land of Israel. Ten great famines were decreed by Heaven to be upon the earth, from the day on which the world was created until the coming of the King-Messiah, to admonish therewith the inhabitants of the earth. The first famine was in the days of Adam. The second famine was in the days of Lemech. The third was in the days of Abraham. The fourth famine was in the days of Isaac. The fifth famine was in the days of Jacob. The sixth famine was in the days of Boaz, who is known as1 Ivzan the Pious of Beth Lehem of Judah. The seventh famine was in the days of David, the king of Israel. The eighth famine was in the days of Elijah the prophet. The ninth famine was in the days of Elisha at Samaria. The tenth famine is due to come, not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but to hear the word of prophecy from the Lord. And when there was this great famine in the Land of Israel, a nobleman went forth out to Beth Lehem of Judah and went to dwell in the field of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion, Ephrathites, noblemen, of Beth Lehem of Judah; and they came unto the field of Moab, and there they were military tribunes."
Ruth,1,3,"Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left a widow, and her two sons were left orphans."
Ruth,1,4,"They transgressed the decree of the Word of the Lord and took unto themselves foreign wives, of the daughters of Moab, the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the second was Ruth, the daughter of Eglon the king of Moab, and they dwelt there for a period of about ten years."
Ruth,1,5,"And because they transgressed the decree of the Word of the Lord by intermarrying with strange peoples, their days were cut short, and the two of them, Mahlon and Kilion, also died, in an unclean land; and the woman was left bereft of her two sons and widowed of her husband."
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law and returned from the field of Moab, for she was informed by an angel, in the field of Moab, that the Lord had remembered his people, the House of Israel, giving them bread, through the merit of the Judge Ivzan by virtue of the prayer which he prayed before the Lord; he is Boaz the Pious."
Ruth,1,7,"She went forth out of the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they were walking on the way to return to the land of Judah."
Ruth,1,8,"Said Naomi to her daughters-in-law: ""Go, return each to her mother's house. May the Lord do kindness unto you, just as you have done unto your deceased husbands, refusing to marry after their death, and unto me, whom you have provided for and sustained."
Ruth,1,9,"""May the Lord reward you fully for the kindness which you have shown to me, and by virtue of that reward may each of you find rest in the house of her husband."" Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"Said they unto her: ""We will not return to our people and our gods, but with you will we return to your people, to become proselytes."""
Ruth,1,11,"Then said Naomi: ""Return, O my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have children in my womb that they might be husbands unto you?"
Ruth,1,12,"""Return, my daughters, from following me. Go unto your people, for I am too old to be married. Should I say: 'Now, if I were a young woman, having hope, verily! should I be married this very night and should I bear sons,'"
Ruth,1,13,"""Would you wait for them until they grew up, like a woman who waits for a small brother-in-law to marry her? Because of them would you sit tied down, not marrying? Pray, my daughters, do not grieve me, for I am more embittered than you, because a stroke from the Lord has come forth against me."""
Ruth,1,14,"Once again they lifted their voices and wept; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung unto her."
Ruth,1,15,"Then said she: ""Behold, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods. Return after your sister-in-law to your people and your gods!"""
Ruth,1,16,"But Ruth said: ""Do not coax me to leave you, to turn from following you, for I desire to become a proselyte."" Said Naomi: ""We are commanded to keep the Sabbaths and holidays, not to walk more than two thousand cubits."" Said Ruth: ""Wheresoever you go I shall go."" Said Naomi: ""We are commanded not to spend the night together with non-Jews."" Said Ruth: ""Wherever you lodge I shall lodge."" Said Naomi: ""We are commanded to keep six hundred thirteen commandments."" Said Ruth: ""That which your people keep, that I shall keep, as though they had been my people before this."" Said Naomi: ""We are commanded not to worship idolatry."" Said Ruth: ""Your God is my God."""
Ruth,1,17,"Said Naomi: ""We have four methods of capital punishment for the guilty -- stoning, burning with fire, death by the sword, and hanging upon the gallows."" Said Ruth: ""To whatever death you are subject I shall be subject."" Said Naomi: ""We have two cemeteries."" Said Ruth: ""There shall I be buried. And do not continue to speak any further. May the Lord do thus unto me and more if [even] death will separate me from you."""
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw that she insisted upon going with her, she ceased to dissuade her."
Ruth,1,19,"The two of them went until they came to Beth Lehem. And it happened that when they came to Beth Lehem all the inhabitants of the city became excited over them and the women said, ""Is this Naomi?"""
Ruth,1,20,"But she said to them: ""Do not call me Naomi [pleasant]; call me the bitter of soul, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me indeed."
Ruth,1,21,"""I went away full, with my husband and sons, but the Lord has brought me back destitute of them. Why, then, should you call me Naomi, seeing that my guilt has been testified to before the Lord, and the Almighty has brought evil upon me?"""
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and with her was Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the field of Moab. And they came to Beth Lehem on the eve of the Passover, and on that very day the Israelites began to harvest the Omer of the heave-offering which was of barley."
Ruth,2,1,"Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a strong man, mighty in the Law, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth, the Moabitess, said to Naomi: ""Let me go now into the field and gather among the ears of grain after him in whose eyes I may find favor."" She said to her, ""Go, my daughter."""
Ruth,2,3,"So she departed and went up and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she chanced upon the part of the field that belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"And behold! Boaz came from Beth Lehem, and he said to the reapers: ""The Word of the Lord be at your assistance!"" They replied, ""The Lord bless you!"""
Ruth,2,5,"Then said Boaz to his servant whom he had appointed overseer of the reapers: ""Of what nation is this young woman?"""
Ruth,2,6,"The servant who was appointed overseer of the reapers answered thus: ""She is a young woman of the people of Moab who returned with Naomi from the field of Moab, and has become a proselyte."
Ruth,2,7,"""She said, 'Please let me gather and glean the ears of grain among the sheaves, that which is left by the reapers.' So she came and has remained since early morning even until now. It is but a short while that she is sitting in the house a little."""
Ruth,2,8,"Then said Boaz to Ruth: ""Will you not listen to me, my daughter? Do not go to gather grain in any other field, nor leave this place to go to another nation, but continue here with my young women."
Ruth,2,9,"""Mark the field that they will reap, and follow them. Have I not charged the servants not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink the water which the servants have drawn."""
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face and bowed to the ground, saying to him: ""Why have I found favor in your eyes that you should befriend me, seeing that I am of a strange people, of the daughters of Moab; of a people which has not the merit to intermarry with the congregation of the Lord?"""
Ruth,2,11,"Boaz replied thus: ""It has been told to me on the authority of the sages, that when the Lord decreed [against intermarriage with Moab], He did not decree against the women, but against the men. Through prophecy I have been informed that kings and prophets are destined to descend from you, because of the kindness which you have shown your mother-in-law, in that you supported her after your husband died, and you left your gods and your people, your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have gone to become a proselyte and to dwell in the midst of a people with whom you were unacquainted before."
Ruth,2,12,"""May the Lord reward you well in this world for your good work, and may you receive full recompense from the Lord, the God of Israel, in the world to come, because you have come to be a proselyte and to seek shelter under the shadow of His Glorious Presence. Through that merit you will be saved from the punishment of Gehinom, so that your portion will be with Sarah and Rebecca and Rachel and Leah."""
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said: ""May I find favor with you, my lord. Verily, you have comforted me by declaring me eligible to join the congregation of the Lord and you have spoken comfortingly to your maidservant by assuring me of possessing the world to come, like a righteous woman, although I have not the merit of having a portion in the world to come even with the least of your maidservants."""
Ruth,2,14,"At mealtime Boaz said to her: ""Come here and eat of the bread, and dip your food in the broth cooked in vinegar."" So she sat down beside the reapers, and he handed her some roasted meal. She ate and was satisfied and left some over."
Ruth,2,15,"When she arose to gather ears of grain, Boaz commanded his servants: ""Let her gather even among the sheaves, and do not put her to shame."
Ruth,2,16,"""Indeed, drop some of the bunches, and leave them for her to glean, and do not reprimand her."""
Ruth,2,17,"So she gathered ears of grain in the field until evening, then she threshed the ears of grain that she had gathered, and the amount was about three seah of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"She carried it and went up to the city, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Then she took out of the bag the food which she had left over after being satisfied, and gave it to her."
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said to her: ""Where did you glean today? Where did you win favor to work? May the man who showed himself friendly to you be blessed."" And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had won the favor to work. ""The name of the man with whom I won favor today is Boaz,"" she said."
Ruth,2,20,"Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law: ""Blessed be he by the holy mouth of the Lord, who has not withheld his kindness from the living or the dead. The man is a relative of ours,"" she continued. ""He is of our redeemers."""
Ruth,2,21,"""Verily!"" said Ruth the Moabitess, ""he also said to me, 'Continue with my servants as long as it takes them to finish all my harvests.'"""
Ruth,2,22,"Then said Naomi to Ruth her daughter-in-law: ""It is well, my daughter, that you should go out with his young women, so that they might not meet you in any other field."""
Ruth,2,23,"So she joined up with the maidservants of Boaz, reaping until the completion of the harvest of barley and the harvest of wheat. And she dwelt with her mother-in-law."
Ruth,3,1,"Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her: ""My daughter, I swear that I shall not rest until I have found comfort for you, that it might be well with you."
Ruth,3,2,"""Now, does not Boaz, our kinsman, with whose maidservants you were in the field, winnow barley at the threshing floor in the night breeze?"
Ruth,3,3,"""Bathe yourself with water, anoint yourself with perfumes, and put on adornments; then go down to the threshing floor, but do not reveal your presence to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"""When he lies down to sleep, however, mark the place where he sleeps; then go in, uncover his feet, and lie down yourself. Then ask advice of him, and in his wisdom he will tell you what to do."""
Ruth,3,5,"And she responded: ""I will do everything that you have told me."""
Ruth,3,6,"So she went down to the threshing floor, and did just as her mother-in-law had instructed her."
Ruth,3,7,"When Boaz had eaten and drunk and felt merry, he blessed the name of the Lord, who had accepted his prayer, in that he removed the famine from the Land of Israel. Then he went to lie down by the side of the grain-heap, and Ruth came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down to sleep."
Ruth,3,8,"And it happened at midnight that the man shuddered and trembled, and, as a result, his flesh became as soft as a [boiled] turnip. Though he perceived a woman sleeping at his feet, he subdued his evil inclination and did not draw nigh unto her, just like the righteous Joseph, who refused to draw nigh unto the Egyptian woman, the wife of his master; and just like the pious Paltiel, the son of Laish, who placed a sword between himself and Michal, the daughter of Saul and wife of David, refusing to approach her."
Ruth,3,9,"""Who are you?"" said he. She responded, ""I am Ruth, your maidservant. Let your name be called over your maidservant, by taking me to wife, inasmuch as you are a redeemer."""
Ruth,3,10,"Said he: ""Blessed be you before the Lord, my daughter. The last good deed which you have done is better than the first. The first was that you became a proselyte, and the last, that you made yourself like a woman who waits for a small brother-in-law until he grows up, refraining from following young men, whether poor or wealthy, in order to carry on immoral relations with them."
Ruth,3,11,"""And now, my daughter, do not fear. What you say to me I will do for you, since it is known to all who sit at the gate, the Great Sanhedrin, of my people, that you are a righteous woman and have the strength to bear the yoke of the commandments of the Lord."
Ruth,3,12,"""Now, in truth, I am a redeemer, but there is also another redeemer who is better qualified to redeem than am I."
Ruth,3,13,"""Lodge here, and in the morning, if the man qualified to redeem you according to the Torah redeems you, very well, let him redeem you. But if he is unwilling to redeem you, then I will redeem you. I swear by an oath before God, that I will do just as I have spoken to you. Sleep now until the morning."""
Ruth,3,14,"So she slept at his feet until morning. At dawn, before one could recognize another because of the darkness, she arose. Then he said to his servants: ""Let it not be known to anyone that a woman came to the threshing floor."""
Ruth,3,15,"[To Ruth he said:] ""Take the scarf which you have there, and lay hold of it,"" he said. So she took hold of it. Then he measured six seah of barley and placed it upon her, whereupon strength to carry it was given to her from God. At that moment it was announced through the medium of prophecy, that six of the most righteous men were destined to descend from her, each one of whom would be blessed with six blessings -- David, Daniel and his companions, and the King-Messiah. Then Boaz went into the city."
Ruth,3,16,"She came to her mother-in-law at daybreak, and Naomi said to her: ""Who are you? My daughter?"" Then she told her everything that the man had done. He had acted on instructions revealed to him through the medium of prophecy."
Ruth,3,17,"""The man gave me these six seah of barley,"" said she, ""Saying to me: 'You must not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.""'"
Ruth,3,18,"Then Naomi said: ""Abide with me at home, my daughter, until you find out how it is decreed by God and how the matter is decided, for the man will not rest unless he complete the matter satisfactorily today."""
Ruth,4,1,"Boaz went up to the gate, the Beth Din of the Sanhedrin, and sat there with the elders, when lo, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken to Ruth passed by. ""Come over,"" said he, ""and sit down here, you, whose ways are secret."" So he turned aside and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"Then he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said to them: ""Sit down here."" And they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"Then he said to the redeemer: ""Naomi, who has returned from the field of Moab, is selling the land inherited by our brother, Elimelech."
Ruth,4,4,"""So I thought I would tell you about it saying, 'Buy it in the presence of those sitting at the gate, the Beth Din of the Sanhedrin, and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you are willing to redeem it, do so; but if you are unwilling, tell me, so that I may know, inasmuch as there is no one who is entitled to redeem before you, and who is as close a relative as you are, as far as buying is concerned. Let me know, then, that I may be the redeemer after you."" ""I will redeem it,"" said he."
Ruth,4,5,"Thereupon Boaz said: ""When you buy the field from Naomi you are also obligated to redeem from Ruth, the Moabitess, the widow of the dead, and you are required to marry her, in order to establish the name of the deceased over his possession."""
Ruth,4,6,"The redeemer replied: ""In that case, I cannot redeem it; because I have a wife, I am not permitted to take another one in addition to her, lest the result be quarrel in my home, and I will be destroying my own possession. You redeem it, since you have no wife; for I am unable to do so."""
Ruth,4,7,"Now the following custom was practiced in Israel in ancient times: When they would carry on business transactions, redeem, and exchange with one another, one would take off his right glove and give it to the other, thereby handing over the right of possession. In this manner the House of Israel was accustomed to make transactions with one another binding, in the presence of witnesses."
Ruth,4,8,"When the redeemer said to Boaz, ""Put forth your hand for the act of acquisition, and buy it yourself,"" Boaz took off his glove and made the purchase."
Ruth,4,9,"Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people: ""Be my witnesses today that I have bought from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and to Mahlon and Kilion."
Ruth,4,10,"""Also Ruth, the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, in order to set up the name of the deceased over his possession, that the name of the dead may not be destroyed from among his brothers, and from the gate, the Sanhedrin, of his place. You are my witnesses today."""
Ruth,4,11,"Then all the people who were at the gate, the Sanhedrin, and the elders, replied: ""We are witnesses. God grant that this woman who comes to your home, be like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built up the house of Israel, our father, with twelve tribes. Do valiantly in Ephrath, and become famous in Beth Lehem."
Ruth,4,12,"""And from the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman, may your house prosper like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah."""
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he had intercourse with her, and God gave her conception, so that she bore a son."
Ruth,4,14,"Then the women said to Naomi: ""Blessed be the name of the Lord, who has not left you without a redeemer today. May the boy's name be among the righteous of Israel."
Ruth,4,15,"""He will be life-sustenance to you and provide your old age with delights; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, she, who during your widowhood was better to you than many sons, gave birth to him."""
Ruth,4,16,"So Naomi took the boy and put him in her bosom, and was his nurse."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women of the neighborhood named him, saying, ""A son has been born to Naomi!"" They called his name Oved. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David."
Ruth,4,18,Now this is the genealogy of Perez: Perez begot Hezron.
Ruth,4,19,"Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Aminadab."
Ruth,4,20,"Aminadab begot Nahshon, who was the head of the household of the tribe of Judah, and Nahshon begot Salma the righteous. He is the Salma of Beth Lehem of Judah, and Netophah, whose sons abolished the guards which the wicked Jeroboam had set over the highways. They served their father, and were becoming children, like balm."
Ruth,4,21,"Salmon begot the judge, Ivzan, who is identical with the righteous Boaz, because of whose merit the Israelite people were saved from their enemies, and because of whose prayer the famine ceased in the Land of Israel. Boaz begot Oved, who served the Master of the Universe with perfect heart."
Ruth,4,22,"Now Oved begot Jesse, who was called Nahash, because no corruption and perversion, for which he might be delivered into the hands of the angel of death, who would take his life from him, were found in him. He lived a long time, until the serpent's counsel to Eve, Adam's wife, to partake of the fruit of the tree, the eating of which resulted in wisdom to distinguish between good and evil, was recalled before God. Because of that counsel, all inhabitants of the earth are mortal, and as a result of that blunder, the righteous Jesse died. He is Jesse, who was the father of David, the king of Israel."
Esther,4,12,"And when the evil Haman saw Hatach, whose real name was Daniel, going out towards Esther, his anger overcame him and he killed him. The angels Michael and Gabriel were summoned, and it was they who brought Esther's message to Mordechai."
Psalms,1,1,"Happy the man who has not walked in the council of the wicked, or stood in the paths of sinners, or taken a seat in the band of mockers."

Ecclesiastes,3,11,"King Solomon said by the spirit of prophecy, God made everything beautiful in its time; for it was opportune that there should be the strife which was in the days of Jeroboam, son of Neboth; it was to have been in the days of Sheba, son of Bichri, and it was delayed, and came to pass in the days of Jeroboam, son of Nebat; for if it had been in the days of Sheba, son of Bichri, the temple would not have been built, because of the golden calves which the wicked Jeroboam made, and placed one in Beth-el and one in Dan, and put watches on the road, and they stopped the pilgrims to the feasts; and therefore it was delayed up to the time when the temple was built, in order not to hinder Israel to build it. He concealed from them also the great Name written and expressed on the foundation-stone, the evil inclinations in their hearts being known to Him; for if it had been delivered into the hands of men, they would have used it, and found by it what will come to pass in the latter days, world without end; and He also hid from them the day of death, in order that it should not be known to man from the beginning what will come to pass at the end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"King Solomon said by the spirit of prophecy, I know that there is nothing good among the children of men, but that they rejoice in the joy of the law, and do good in the days of their life."
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"And also that if any man eats and drinks and sees good in his days, and causes his children to inherit all his labour in the time of his death, this is a gift given to him from the Lord."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know by the spirit of prophecy, that everything which the Lord does in the world, whether good or evil, whatsoever is decreed from His month, will be for ever; to it man has no power to add, nor has any one power to take from it; and at the same time, when punishment comes into the world, it is the Lord who does it, that the children of man may fear before Him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,What has been from the beginning has come to pass; and what will be at the end of days has already happened; and at the great day of judgment the Lord will demand the poor and the needy from the hands of the wicked who persecuted him.
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"And further, I saw under the sun in this world, the place of judgment, in which false judges condemn the innocent, in his judgment, in order to acquit the guilty; and the place where the innocent is found, there the guilty is to tyrannise over him, because of the guilt of the wicked generation."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said in my heart, that God will judge in the great day of judgement the righteous and the guilty, because a time is appointed for every thing, and for every work done in this world they will be judged there."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said in my heart concerning the children of men, as to the chastisements and evil events which come upon them, God sends these to try and to prove them, to see whether they will return in repentance and be forgiven and healed; but the wicked who are like beasts do not repent, therefore they are reproved thereby to their own condemnation."
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For as to the destiny of the wicked, and the destiny of the unclean beast, it is one destiny for both of them; and as the unclean beast dies so he dies who does not return in repentance before his death; and the breath of life over both is judged alike in every manner, and the advantage of a sinner over the unclean beast is nothing but the burial place; for all is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go to one place; all the inhabitants of the earth are made of dust, and when they die, all return to the dust."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who is wise to know the breathing spirit of the children of men, whether it goes upward to heaven, and the breathing spirit of cattle, whether it goes down to the earth?"
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"I saw, therefore, that there is no good in this world, but that man should rejoice in his good works, and eat and drink, and do good to his heart; because this is his good part in this world, to acquire thereby the world to come, so that no man should say in his heart, “Why am I distributing money to do charity? I had better leave it to my son after me, or be nursed tor it in my old age;"" because who can bring him to see what will be after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"And I turned and saw all the oppressions which are done to the righteous in this world under the sun, from the hand of their oppressors; and there is none that should speak consolation to them; and there is none to deliver them from the hand of their oppressors with strong hand and power, and none comforts them."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,"And I praised the dead who have long since died, and do not see the punishment which comes into the world after their death, more than the living, who live in this world in so much misery, till now."
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"And better than both of them is he who has not lived till now, and has not been created, who does not see the bad doings which are done in this work under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,"And I saw all the trouble and every good work which the children of men do, to be nothing but jealousy, man emulating his neighbour, to do like him; he who emulates his neighbour to do good like him, the word of heaven will do him good; and if he emulate him in evil, to do like his badness, the word of heaven will do him evil; and also these things are vanity for the wicked, and breaking of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,4,5,"The fool goes and folds his hands in summer, and will not labour; and in winter eats all he has, even the garment from the skin of his flesh."
Ecclesiastes,4,6,"Better for a man one handful of food with comfort of soul, and without rapine and violence, than two handsful of eating with rapine and violence, which in future will be requited in the judgment in labour and breaking of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,4,7,And I turned and saw the vanity which is destined to be in this world under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is a solitary man, and no second besides him, he has even no son nor brother to inherit his property, and there is no end to all his labour, and even his eye cannot be satisfied with his riches, and he does not say to his heart, “Why am I labouring and restraining my soul from good? I will arise now, and will do charity therefrom, and will be joyful in this world with the children of men, and with the righteous in the world to come;” this, too, is vanity, and an evil work."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,"Better two righteous in a generation than one, and it is they who lead successfully, and cause their words to be heard; they have a good reward in the world to come for their labours which they laboured to sustain their generation."
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if one of them falls upon the bed and lies sick, the other will cause his friend to rise by his prayer; but if there is only one innocent man in a generation, if he falls upon the bed and lies sick, he has no companion in his generation to pray for him, yet shall he rise by his own merit from his sickness."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Also if two sleep together—a man and his wife, they will be warm in the winter; but one, how can he be warm?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if a wicked and strong man rises in a generation, and his works are injurious, and cause punishments to come in the world, two righteous shall stand up against him, and abolish the punishment by their merits; and how much more useful are three righteous who are in a generation, and peace is among them, like a chain that is woven of three-fold cords, which does not easily break."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,"Better, i. e., Abraham who is the poor youth, and in whom was the spirit of prophecy from the Lord, and to whom the Lord was known when three years old, and who would not worship an idol—than the wicked Nimrod, who was an old and foolish king. And because Abraham would not worship an idol, he threw him into the burning furnace, and a miracle was performed for him from the Lord of the world, and he delivered him from it; and even after this, Nimrod had no sense to be admonished not to worship the idol which he worshipped before."
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For Abraham went out from the family of idolaters, and reigned over the land of Canaan, for even in the reign of Abraham, Nimrod became poor in the world."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"King Solomon said. By the spirit of prophecy from the Lord, I foresaw all the living who walk in their folly rebel against Rehoboam, my son, under heaven, and divide his kingdom to give it to Jeroboam, son of Nebat — except the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, whose heart was faithful with the boy, that is, Rehoboam my son, who, second in my kingdom, is to rise and reign in Jerusalem, the place of his inheritance."
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There was no end to all the house of Israel, to all the righteous before whom he ruled; but they advised him in their wisdom to lighten their yoke, and he in his folly went and took counsel with the youth, and they in their folly, advised him to make heavier the yoke of his kingdom upon the people of the house of Israel, and he left the advice of the aged, and followed the advice of the latter; but these latter ones were afterwards confounded and displeased with him, and they caused him to flee, so that the ten tribes should separate from him ; and the wicked Jeroboam ruled over them ; I said this too is vanity for Rehoboam my son, and breaking of spirit to him."
Ecclesiastes,4,17,"Thou son of man, guard thy feet when thou goest to the sanctuary of the Lord to pray, so that thou goest not there full of sin before thou has repented, and incline thine ear to receive the teaching of the Law from the priests and sages, and be not like fools, who bring sacrifices for their sins, and do not leave off their evil works which they hold in their hands, and they have no acceptance, for they know not whether they do good or evil therewith."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Do not hurry on thy language so as to make a mistake in the words of thy mouth, and let not thy heart make a vow, resolving to do something at the time when thou prayest before the Lord, for the Lord rules over all the world, and sits upon the throne of glory in the high heavens, and thou sittest on earth, therefore let the words of thy mouth be few."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"For as a dream comes through the thoughts of the heart engaged in a multitude of business, so the noise of the fool through the multitude of empty words."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"When thou vowest a vow before the Lord, do not defer to pay it, for the Lord hath no pleasure in fools, because they defer their vows and do not pay, but thou, whatsoever thou vowest, pay."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"It is better for thee that thou vowest not, than that thou vowest and pay not."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,"Do not degrade the words of thy mouth to cause judgments of Gehenna upon thy flesh; and in the day of the great judgment thou wilt not be able to say before the avenging angel who exercises dominion over thee, that it is an error; why then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against the voice of thy shamefully uttered language, and destroy the works of thine hand?"
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"For in the multitude of the dreams of the false prophets, and in the vanities of sorcerers, and in the many words of the wicked, believe not, but serve the wise and the just; from them seek instruction, and fear before the Lord."
Ecclesiastes,5,7,"When thouseest the oppression of the poor, robbery, and justice in the city, be not astonished in thy heart, saying, How can the will of the Lord be with all this? for the mighty God from on high watches the works of the children of men, whether good or evil, and from his presence are sent forth proud and powerful men to rule over the wicked, and to be appointed masters over them."
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"And the great advantage of cultivating the land is above all, for when the subjects of a country revolt, and the king flies from them into the country, if he has no more to eat, this very king becomes subject to a labourer in the field."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,"A merchant who loves to acquire money, and men of business, shall not be satisfied in amassing money ; and he who loves to heap up great mammon, has no praise in the world to come, unless he has done charity with it, because he has not deserved to eat fruit; this, too, is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"When good is multiplied in the world, the children of men who eat it are also multiplied; and what advantage is there to the owner who gathers it unless he does good with it, that he may see in the world to come the reward given with his eyes."
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"Sweet is the sleep of a man who serves the Lord of the world with all his heart; and he has rest in his grave, whether he lives few years or many years; after having served the Lord of the world in this world, he will inherit in the world to come a reward for the works of his hand. And the wisdom of the Law of God belongs to the man who is rich in wisdom; in the same manner as he occupies himself with it in this world, and exerts himself in learning, so will it rest with him in the grave, and not leave him alone; just as a woman does not leave her husband to sleep alone."
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"There is a sore evil which I saw in this world under the sun, and there is no remedy for it; a man who gathers riches and does no good with them, and at the end of days these riches are kept for him for his condemnation in the world to come."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"And the riches,which he leaves to his son after his death, shall perish, because he got them in an evil employment, and they shall not abide in the hand of the son whom he has begotten, and nothing whatever shall remain in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"As he came out of his mother's womb naked, without a covering, and without any good, so shall he return to his grave, void of merit, just as he came into this world; and he shall receive no good reward whatever for his labour, to carry with him into the world whither he goes, to be a merit in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"And this also is a sore evil, and there is no remedy for it, as he came into this world void of merit, so he shall depart into that world; and what advantage has he that he labored for his spirit?"
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"Also all his days he dwells iu darkness, that he may eat his bread alone, and he sees in much indignation, and his life is in sickness and vexation."
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"And behold that which I have seen good for the children of men, and that which is comely for them to do in this world, that they eat and drink from their labours, in order not to put forth the hand to oppression and rapine, and to keep the words of the law, and to have compassion on the poor, so that they may see good in all their labours wherewith they labour in this world under the sun, the number of the days of a man's life, which God in his providence gives to him; for this is his portion, and none's beside him."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Also every man to whom the Lord has given riches and wealth, and if the Lord gave him power to eat of it in this world, and to do good with it, and to receive a full reward iu the world to come, and to rejoice in his work with the righteous, behold! this is a gift which is given to him in providence, it is from the Lord."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"For not many are the days of man's life; who tries to find out the days of his life, how many of them will be good, and how many of them will be evil? because it is not in the power of the children of men; but it is fixed about him from the Lord, how many days he shall suffer, and how many days he shall be in the joy of his heart."
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is an evil which I saw in this world under the sun, and it is great upon the children of man."
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"A man to whom God gave in his providence riches, honour, and wealth, and his soul lacks nothing of all which he desires, and the Lord has not given him power, on account of his sins, to enjoy it; but he dies without issue, and his kinsman would not take possession of his inheritance, wherefore his wife will be married to a stranger, and he will take away the inheritance and consume it; all this his sins have brought upon him, because he did therewith no good whatever, and his riches turned out to be to him vanity and a sore evil."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man should beget a hundred children, and live many years, and be in power and dominion all the days of his life, and his soul has not enjoyed the good which he has, because he loved his riches, and has not acquired therewith a good name, nor even prepared himself a grave, I say by the divine word, better than he an untimely birth, which has not seen this world."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"For in vanity he came into this world, and departs in darkness into that world; and in darkness is his name covered, because he has no merit, and has not acquired a good name worthy of remembrance."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"And even the light of the sun he saw not, and did not know good from evil, to discern between this world and the world to come."
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"And if the days of the life of this man were two thousand years, and he had not studied the Law, and had not done judgment and justice by the oath of the word of the Lord, in the day of his death his soul will go to Gehenna, to the same place whither all sinners go."
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"As for all the labours of man, he labours for the food of his mouth; and by the word of the mouth of the Lord he is sustained, and even the soul of man is not satisfied with eating and drinking."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,"For what advantage has the wise man in this world over the fool, because of the wicked generation by which he is not accepted; and what is this poor man to do but to study the law of the Lord, that he may know how he will have to walk in the presence of the righteous in paradise."
Ecclesiastes,6,9,"It is better for a man to rejoice about the world to come, and to do righteousness, and to see a good reward for his labours in the day of the great judgment than to go into that world with an afflicted soul; for this is vanity, and a breaking of spirit to a guilty man."
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"That which has been in the world, behold! its name has long been called, and has been made known to the children of men from the day that the first Adam existed, and all is the decree of the Lord; and men cannot stand in judgment with the Lord of the world, who is stronger than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"For there are many things which multiply vanity in the world, what advantage has the man who is occupied with them?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who is he that knows what will do men good in this world, but to study the Law, which is the life of the world; and all the number of the days of his vain life which he lives, are in the time of his death considered like a shadow; for who is he that can tell man what there is before him in this world under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,"Better the good name which the righteous acquire in this world, than the anointing oil which was poured upon the heads of kings and priests; and the day wherein a man dies and departs to the grave with a good name and merits, than the day wherein the wicked is born into the world."
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to a mourning man to comfort him, than to go to the house of a feast of wine of the scorners; for into the house of mourning thither is the end of all men to go, for upon all is decreed the decree of death, and by going into the house of mourning the righteous man sits down and takes to heart the words of death; and if there be any evil in his hand he will leave it, and return in repentance before the Lord of the world."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Better is the anger wherewith the Lord of the world is angry with the righteous in this world, than the laughter wherewith he laughs at the wicked; for by the displeasure of the face of the Shechinah come famine and punishment into the world to improve the heart of the righteous, and they pray before the Lord of the world, who has mercy upon them."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The heart of the wise mourns over the destruction of tlie temple, and grieves over the captivity of the house of Israel; and the heart of fools is in the joy of the house of their scoffings; they eat and drink and fare sumptuously, and do not take to heart the affliction of their brethren."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,"Better to sit at the teaching of the house of instruction, and to hear the reproof of the wise in the Law, than for a man to go to hear the sound of a musical instrument of a fool."
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the sound of the crackling of thorns which burn under a pot, so is the noisy laughter of the fool; this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"For the robber mocks at the wise man because he goes not in his way, and destroys with his evil speech the prudent heart of the wise, which was given to him as a gift from heaven."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,"Better the end of a thing than the beginning thereof, for in its beginning man knows not what its end will be, but the end of a good thing is known to a good man; and better before the Lord is a man who rules over his spirit and subdues his carnal thouglits, than a man who walks in the pride of his spirit."
Ecclesiastes,7,9,"And when chastisements from heaven come upon thee, do not hasten thy heart to anger, and to utter words of rebellion against heaven, for if thou bearest them patiently, they will depart from thee; and if thou art rebellious and angry, know that anger rests in the lap of fools till it has destroyed them."
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"In the time of oppression, say not what was before now was good in the world; for the former days were better, and the men of that generation had better doings than these, therefore good came to them; and thou askest not according to wisdom about this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,"Good is the wisdom of the law, along with the inheritance of money, and better still for a man to humbly conduct himself with men, the dwellers of the earth, who see good and evil under the sun in this world."
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For as a man is sheltered under the shadow of wisdom, so he is sheltered under the shadow of money, when he does alms with it; and the advantage of knowing the wisdom of the law is that it raises its possessor from the grave for the world to come."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Consider the work of the Lord, and his strength, who made the blind, the hunchback, and the lame, to be wonders in the world; for who is he that can make straight one of these, but the Lord of the world who made him crooked ?"
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day when the Lord is doing good, be thou also happy and do good to all the world; that the evil day may not come upon thee, see and behold! and also God has made this against that to reprove the men of the world, so that man should not find after him any evil in the world to come."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"All this I saw in the days of my vanity, that from the Lord are decreed good and evil to be in the world, according to the planets under which the children of men are created; for there is a righteous man perishing in his righteousness in this world, and his merit is kept for him for the world to come; and there is a wicked man who prolongs his days in his guilt, and the account of his evil doings is kept for him for the world to come, to be requited for it in the day of the great judgment."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,"Be not over-righteous when the guilty is found guilty of death in thy court of judgment, so as to have compassion on him and not to kill him; and do not thus become over-wise with the wisdom of the wicked who stand in the way, and do not learn their ways; why, then, wilt thou destroy thy way?"
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Go not after the thought of thy heart to sin much, and do not make thy way far from the teaching of the law of God to become a fool; why shouldst thou cause death to thy soul, and the years of thy life be shortened to die, before thy time comes to die?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18,"It is good thou shouldst combine the affairs of this world, namely, to do good to thyself in the way of merchants, and also that thou hold fast thy portion in the Book of the Law, for a man fearing before the Lord performs the duty of both."
Ecclesiastes,7,19,"And the wisdom of Joseph, son of Jacob, helped him to make him wise before his ten righteous brethren, who ruled in the fear of the Lord; and the evil spirit did not rule in them when they were in the metropolis of Egypt, and did not kill their brother Joseph who annoyed them at that time with the voice of his words."
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"For there is no righteous man in the land, who does good all his days, and sins not before the Lord; but the man who sins before the Lord, it behoves him to return in repentance before he dies."
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Moreover give not thy heart to accept all the words which the wicked speak to thee, that the days may not come when thou shalt hear thy servant curse thee, aud thou hast not the power to be delivered from his hands."
Ecclesiastes,7,22,"Then see to it, adjudicate thy cause when a man curses thee who is not like thyself; for also many times thy heart knows that thou too hast cursed other men."
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"All that I said f have tried by wisdom: I said by my word, I shall also be wise in all the wisdom of the Law, but it was far from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,"Behold, long has it been far from the children of men to know all that has been from the days of old; and who is he that will find out by his wisdom the secret of the day of death, and the secret of the day when the King Messiah will come?"
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I turned to think in my heart, and to know and to examine and to seek wisdom, and the estimate of the reward of the works of the righteous, and to know the punishment of the guilt of the fool, and the understanding of the fear of the Kingdom."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I found a thing more bitter to man than the bitterness of the day of death, namely, a woman who causes much tribulation to her husband, and entangles him; in whose heart are snares, and whose hands are bound that she might not work with them; the righteous before God is the man who gets rid of her by a bill of divorcement, and relieves himself of her; but the guilty before God is the man who abides with her, and is ensnared with her adultery."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"Behold,thisis the work which I have found, said Coheleth, who is called Solomon, King of Israel, I have examined the planets one in connection with the other, to find out the account of the children of men, what will be in their end."
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"There is another thing which my soul is still seeking, and I have not found, namely, a perfect and just man, without any corruption, as Abraham; from the days of the first Adam till the righteous Abraham was born, who was found faithful and just among the thousand kings that gathered together to build the tower of Babel? and a woman, as Sarah, among all the wives of those kings, I have not found."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Only, behold! this I found, that God made the first Adam upright before him and just; and the serpent and Eve seduced him to eat of the fruit of the tree, because those who eat its fruit would be wise to discern between good and evil, and they brought upon him and all the inhabitants of the earth the day of death; and they sought to find many accounts in order to bring terror upon the inhabitants of the earth."
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who is as a wise man, that he can stand before the wisdom of the Lord, and know the interpretations of his words, like the prophets? The wisdom of a wise man enlightens the brightness of his face among the righteous, and as for the impudent, all his ways are changed from good to bad."
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"Guard thy mouth about the commands of the King to keep whatsoever he commands, and be also on thy guard about the matter of an oath of the Lord, that thou swear not by the name of his word in vain."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,"And in the time of the anger of the Lord do not cease to pray before him, tremble before him, go and pray and seek mercy from him, because thou canst not stand in an evil matter; for the Lord of all worlds, the Lord, will do what he pleases."
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"In the place where the word of the King who rules over all the world is gone forth, it is done immediately, and who is the man that would restrain his hand, and say unto him, What doest thou?"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"The man who keeps the commandments of the Lord shall not know any evil in the world to come; and the time of prayer, and judgment, and truth,  is known in the heart of the wise."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"For to every business there is a good and an evil time, and by a true judgment is the whole world judged; and when it is decreed from the Lord that punishment should be in the world, it is because of the guilt of evil doers which is heavy upon them."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,"For no wise man knows what will bewith him at the end, for when it shall be the pleasure before the Lord to afflict him, who is he that will tell him it?"
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"There is no man who has power over his breathing soul to retain the soul of life, that it should not depart from the human body; and there is no power in the day of death for a man to save his companion, and no instruments of war to help in the battle, and guilt will not save its master in the great day of judgment."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this I saw which has happened in this world, and I gave my heart to know all the work which is worked in this world under the sun, at the time when man rules over man to afflict him."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"And indeed I have seen sinners who are buried and blotted out of the world, from the holy place where the righteous dwell, and went to be burned in Gehenna, and are forgotten from among the inhabitants of the city, and as they have done to others, so it is done to them; also this is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"And because the evil thing, the punishment of the wicked, is not quickly executed upon their evil works, therefore the heart of the children of men is full in them to do evil in this world."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"And when a sinner does evil a hundred years, and space is given him from the Lord in order that he may repent, yet is it revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, and I know that it will be well in the world to come with those that fear the Lord, that fear before him,and do his will;"
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"and that it shall not be well with the wicked, and there shall be no space for him in the world to come; and in this world the days of his life shall be cut off, they shall fly and pass away like a  shadow, because he feared not before the Lord."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a vanity that is decreed to be done upon the face of the earth; there are righteous to whom evil happens as if they had done like the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked to whom it happens as if they had done like the works of the righteous; and I saw by the Holy Spirit that the evil which happens to the righteous in this world is not for their guilt, but to free them from a slight transgression, that their reward may be perfect in the world to come; and the good that comes to the sinners in this world is not for their merits, but to render them a reward for their small merit they have acquired, so that they may eat their reward in this world, and to destroy their portion in the world to come; I said, by my word, this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"And I praised the joy of the Law, since there is no good for man in this world under the sun, but to eat and drink and rejoice in his labour and in his portion, which is given to him from heaven, and not stretch out his hands in violence and rapine; and this will lead him to peace in that world, and he shall receive a perfect reward for his labours wherewith he sincerely laboured all the days of his life, which the Lord gave him in this world under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"As I gave my heart to know the wisdom of the Law, and to see the business which is done upon the earth, for even the wise who desires to be occupied with the Law and to find wisdom must toil, since he has no rest in the day, and sees no sleep with his eyes in the night."
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"And I saw every mighty work of the Lord, for it is awful; and man cannot find out the mighty work of the Lord which is done in this world under the sun; when man labours to seek what will be, he shall not find it; and even if a wise man says by his word, that he will know what will be at the end of days, he cannot find it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"Chapter9 line1 For all this I set my heart to investigate all this that the righteous and the wise and their students who serve them on the business of the study of Torah and are given in the hand of god and from him is decreed on all the world all what will be in their days even the mercy they will feel even the hatred they will feel, there is no person who is a prophet in the world who will know what will be in people: All in their mazal[luck or planet]  God decrees to be ahead of them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"2 Everything depends on mazal, from heaven it is decreed what will happen in the future to the entire earth, One to the innocent and the guilty, who fixes his way and makes modest his soul,and one who defiles his soul [makes himself impure]  one who sacrifices a holy property and one who does not sacrifice a holy property, like the good like the guilty, like a man whose days are for lying like a man who fears an oath."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"3 This is an evil mazal in all the world that is done under the sun, for one happening is for all, to all the inhabitants of the earth, even if the heart of  people is filled with badness about  this, and intrigues are in their heart, all the days of their life. and after a man’s end it is saved for him to argue with the dead about the judgement of the guilty."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,4  For who is the man who adheres to all the words of the Torah to purchase the life of the world to come? He has hoper. For a live dog is better than a lion that is dead.
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"5 For the righteous know that if they sin, they will be considered as dead in the world to come. Therefore, they guard their ways and do not sin and if they sin, they return in repentance. But the sinners do not know anything good because they do not make their deeds good in their lifetime and they do not know anything good in the world to come and they do not have a good reward after their death for their memory is forgotten from the righteous."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"6 After the death of the wicked they have no needs. Their love, their hatred, and their envy have already perished from the world and they no longer have a good portion with the righteous in the world to come. And they have no pleasure from anything that is done in this world under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"7  Solomon said by the spirit of prophecy from before the Lord, “The Master of the World will say to all the righteous ones individually, Go eat in joy your bread which was given to you for the bread which you gave to the poor and the needy who were hungry, and drink with a happy heart your wine which is hidden for you in the Garden of Eden in exchange for the wine which you mixed for the poor and needy who were thirsty. For God has already accepted your good deeds."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,8 At all times let your garments be white without all stain of sin and acquire a good name which is compared to anointing oil so that blessing may come upon your head and your goodness will not be lacking.
Ecclesiastes,9,9,9 See a good life with a wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which the Lord gave you by your mazal in this world under the sun. For it is your portion in your life and in your labor wherein you labor in this world under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"10. Whatever charity your hand finds to do, do for the needy with all your strength, for after  death a man has neither work nor reckoning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave where you are going and nothing will help you but good deeds and charity alone."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"11. King Solomon said, “While I was sitting on my royal throne, I observed and saw in this world under the sun that not men who are swift as the eagle are  helped to run to escape death in battle and heroes are not helped by their might when they instigate a war and also sages are not helped by their wisdom to be sated with bread in a time of famine and the intelligent are not helped by their intelligence to be sated with bread in a time of famine and even those who are wise are not assisted by their wisdom to gather the grain place and the discerning are not helped by their knowledge to find mercy in the eyes of the king. For time and chance happen to all of them according to their mazal."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"12. For even it is not made known to a man his time, whether good or bad what will be in the world and come upon him. Like fish of the sea which are captured in a net and like birds of heaven which are captured in a snare, like them people are snared in an evil time which falls on them in one moment from the sky."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"13. Also this I saw, that she is wisdom in this world under the sun and it is much to me."
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"14. The body of a man is compared to a little city and heroes, a few  soldiers are in its midst and are slight in its merit in the heart of man  helpful to the body [against] the evil inclination which may be compared to a great and powerful king enters the body to conquer and it surrounds the heart in order to make it err and it builds against it a dwelling place because it wishes to cause him to depart from the way which is straight before the Lord to capture him in the great snares of Gehenna in order to burn him seven times for his sins."
Ecclesiastes,9,15,15. And there was found in the body the good inclination humble and wise and it prevailed over it and conquered it by its wisdom and it saved the body from the judgment of Gehenna by its power and its wisdom just as the soldier does battle and saves the inhabitants of the city by the wisdom of his heart and no man remembered afterward the good inclination which saved him but says to himself “I am innocent just as the inhabitants of the city do not remember that poor man who saved them.
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"16. And I said ,the good words of the righteous are  better than the force of the heroism of the sinner, for the wisdom of the righteous and his merit saves him and the people of his generation. But the strength of the wicked who persists in the stubbornness of his heart without returning in repentance destroys only him. And the wisdom of the righteous poor is despised in the eyes of the wicked of his generation and when he reproves them for their evil deeds the words of reprove are not accepted."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,17. The word of the silent prayer of the sages are accepted by the Master of World more than the acceptance of the wicked man who rules over fools who entreats but is not accepted.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,18. The wisdom of the wise in the time of trouble is better than weapons when war breaks out one sinner in a generation causes much good to be destroyed from the world.

Ecclesiastes,10,5,"ה.  5. There is an evil  I saw in this world under the sun and it causes damage in the world like a matter of error which proceeds hurriedly against a man from a ruler.  6. He gave the wicked and  foolish Edom to enjoy mazal (good fortune) and to enjoy prosperity from the highest heavens and his armies are proud and numerous while the people of the house of Israel are enslaved under him in exile, and from their many sins, those rich in property become poor andin their poverty dwell among the nations.  ..."

Ecclesiastes,10,9,"9. King Solomon the prophet said, “It was revealed to me that Manasseh the son of Hezekiah will sin and bow to idols of stone, therefore he will be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria who will bind him with chains because he made light of the words of Torah which were originally written on tablets of stone, therefore, he will suffer for them, And Rabshakeh his brother will worship images of wood and leave the words of the Torah which were put in the ark of acacia wood, therefore he will be burned with fire by the angel of 'ה.”  ..."
Ecclesiastes,10,10,"10. And when the people of Israel sin, and the heavens will become hard as iron and not give rain and that generation does not pray before 'ה so that the rain does not fall therefore, the whole world is wasted by famine, and when they repent and are assembled overcome their Yetzer  and appoint leaders to seek mercy from the God of Heaven, they have pleasure due to the abundance of the excellence of their wisdom.  ..."
Ecclesiastes,10,11,"11. When seraphim [snakes] are stirred up to bite and to cause harm in the world, it is on account of the sins of Israel who do not engage in the words of Torah quietly, and also there is no advantage for a slanderer who speaks with a third tongue for he will be burned in the fire of Gehenum.  ..."

Do not curse the king even in your thought in the secret places of your heart. and do not curse the sage in your bedroom, for the angel Raziel proclaims everyday from heaven upon Mt.

Ecclesiastes,12,10,"10. King Solomon, who was called Kohelet, tried in his wisdom to judge people according to the thoughts of their hearts (minds)  without witnesses. Therefore, it was told to him by the spirit of prophecy from 'ה, this is already  written in the Torah by Moses the teacher of Israel-- proper are the words and true: ""By the word of witnesses shall the matter be established."""
Ecclesiastes,12,11,"11. The words of the sages are compared to goads and nails, which are fastened to teach wisdom to those without  knowledge, just as a goad teaches the ox, and the rabbis of the Sanhedrin are masters of halacha, and midrash, which was given by Moses the Prophet, who alone fed the people of Israel in the desert with manna and delicacies."
Ecclesiastes,12,12,"12. And more than these, my son, be careful to make books of wisdom without end, but  occupy yourself much with words of Torah and become wise with weariness of  flesh."
Ecclesiastes,12,13,"13. Every word which is done in the world in secret will ultimately be publicized and announced to all of mankind.

Ecclesiastes,12,14,14. For  every deed  'ה will bring  to the great day of judgment and will make public all the hidden words of people  whether good or evil.
Lamentations,1,1,"Jeremiah the Prophet and High Priest said, “<b>How</b> was it decreed that Jerusalem and her people should be punished with banishment and that they should be mourned with 'ekah. Just as when Adam and Eve were punished and expelled from the Garden of Eden and the Master of the Universe mourned them with 'ekah?” The Attribute of Justice replied and said, “Because of the greatness of her rebellious sin that was within her, thus she will <b>dwell alone</b> as a man plagued with leprosy upon his skin who sits alone. And <b>the city that was full</b> of crowds and many <b>peoples</b> has been emptied of them and <b>she has become like a widow. She who was great among the nations and a ruler over provinces </b>that<b> had</b> brought her <b>tribute</b> has become lowly again and gives head tax to them from thereafter.”"
Lamentations,1,2,"When Moses the Prophet sent messengers to spy out the land, the messengers returned and gave forth a bad report concerning the land of Israel. This was the night of the ninth of Ab. When the people of the House of Israel heard this bad report which they had received concerning the land of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and <b>the people</b> of the House of Israel <b>wept that night.</b> Immediately the anger of the LORD was kindled against them and he decreed that it should be so in that night throughout their generations over the destruction of the Temple. When it was told through prophecy to Jeremiah the High Priest that Jerusalem would be destroyed at the hand of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar unless they repented, he immediately entered and rebuked the people of the House of Israel, but they refused to accept it. Therefore the wicked Nebuchadnezzar came and razed Jerusalem and set fire to the Temple on the ninth day in the month of Ab. On that night, the Congregation of Israel <b>wept bitterly and her tears flowed down her cheeks. There was no one to speak comfortingly to her</b> heart <b>from among all</b> her idols after whom <b>she loved</b> to follow. As a result, <b>all her friends</b> were wicked to her; they <b>turned against her and became her enemies.</b>"
Lamentations,1,3,"The House of <b>Judah went into exile because they were oppressing</b> the orphans and the widows and because of <b>the great servitude</b> to which they were subjecting their brothers, the sons of Israel, who had been sold to them. And they did not declare freedom to their servants and handmaids who were of the seed of Israel. As a result they themselves were delivered into the hand of the nations. And the Congregation of the House of Judah <b>dwells among the nations and finds no rest</b> from the hard labor to which they subject her. <b>All who pursued her overtook her </b>as she was hiding<b> in the border regions</b> and they persecuted her."
Lamentations,1,4,"All the while that Jerusalem was built, the sons of Israel refused to go up to be seen before the LORD three times a year. Because of Israel’s sins Jerusalem was destroyed and <b>the roads to Zion are made mournful, for there is no one entering her at the time of the festivals. All the gates are desolate and her priests groan</b> because the sacrifices have ceased. <b>Her virgins mourn</b> because they have stopped going out on the fifteenth of Ab and on the Day of Atonement (which is on the tenth day of Tishri) to dance the dances. <b>Therefore she too is very bitter in her heart.</b>"
Lamentations,1,5,<b>Those who oppress her</b> were appointed over her <b>as leaders and her enemies </b>were dwelling at ease<b> since the LORD had broken her due to her great rebelliousness. Her children go before the oppressor into captivity.</b>
Lamentations,1,6,"<b>All the glory of the Congregation of Zion has gone out from her.

They went out</b> in great weakness and <b>they had no strength</b> to flee to safety (from) <b>before the pursuer.</b>"
Lamentations,1,7,"Jerusalem remembered the days of old, when she was surrounded by walled cities and strong open towns, <b>rebelling </b>and reigning over all the earth, and <b>all her lovely things which she had in earlier times. </b>But because of her sins, <b>her people fell into the hands </b>of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar and he oppressed them and <b>there was no one to save her. The persecutors watched </b>her go into captivity <b>and they laughed because </b>her good fortune had<b> ceased from her.</b>"
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem sinned a great sin, therefore she has become a wanderer. All the nations that <b>had honored her </b>in earlier times <b>treat her with contempt for they have seen her nakedness. But she groans and shrinks back.</b>"
Lamentations,1,9,"The impurity of the menstrual blood <b>in her skirts</b> has not been cleansed from her. And she did not regret her sins, nor <b>did she think of </b>what would befall her in <b>the end</b> of days. <b>And she went down </b>and fell and<b> was set aside. </b>And <b>there was no one to speak comfortingly to her. Look, O Lord </b>and see <b>for my enemies have exalted themselves over me.</b>"
Lamentations,1,10,"The wicked <b>Nebuchadnezzar stretched out his hand</b> and drew forth his sword and <b>cut off all her lovely things.</b> Indeed, the Congregation of Israel began to howl for <b>she saw foreign nations go into her Temple; those about whom you commanded</b> by Moses the prophet concerning Ammon and Moab, <b>that they were not</b> worthy <b>to enter your assembly.</b>"
Lamentations,1,11,All the people of Jerusalem <b>groan</b> from hunger <b>and search for bread</b> to eat. <b>They gave their precious things for</b> the sustenance of <b>bread in order to stay alive. Look O Lord and see for I have become voracious.</b>
Lamentations,1,12,"I adjure you, all who pass by on the road, turn around here.<b> Look and see. Is there any pain like my pain, that which has been visited upon me because the Lord shattered me in the day of his great anger?</b>"
Lamentations,1,13,"From heaven he sent fire into my strong cities and conquered them. He spread a net for my feet. He caused me to shrink back before my enemies.<b> He caused me to be desolate all day, unclean and </b>weak."
Lamentations,1,14,"<b>The yoke of my rebellion</b> was heavy <b>in his hand. Intertwined</b> like the tendrils of a vine, <b>they climbed upon my neck. My strength is weakened. The Lord has given me into the hands of one whom I cannot withstand.</b>"
Lamentations,1,15,The Lord has crushed all my mighty ones within me; he has established a time against me to shatter the strength of<b> my young men. </b>The nations entered by the decree of the Memra of <b>the Lord</b> and defiled <b>the virgins of the House of Judah</b> until their blood of their virginity was caused to flow like wine from a wine <b>press</b> when a man is <b>treading</b> grapes and the wine of his grapes flows.
Lamentations,1,16,"<b>Because</b> of the infants who were smashed and the pregnant mothers whose bellies were ripped open, the Congregation of Israel said, <b>“I weep</b> and <b>my eyes flow with</b> tears, a spring of <b>water, for far from me is any comforter to revive </b>me and speak words of comfort for<b> my soul.

Lamentations,1,17,"<b>Zion spreads out her hands</b> from anguish like a woman spread upon the birth stool. She screams but <b>there is no one to speak comfortingly to her</b> heart. <b>The Lord commanded</b> the House of <b>Jacob</b> to keep the commandments and Torah, but they transgressed the decree of his Memra. Therefore <b>his oppressors</b> completely <b>encircle</b> Jacob. <b>Jerusalem is</b> like an <b>unclean</b> woman <b>amongst them.</b>"
Lamentations,1,18,"The Lord told the people of the House of Israel that they should not allow those who kill by the sword to pass through their land. Josiah the king went forth and drew his sword against Pharaoh the Lame on the plain of Megiddo, which he had not been commanded [to do] and he had not sought instruction from before the Lord. Therefore archers shot arrows at King Josiah and he died there. Before his spirit left him he moved his lips and said, <b>“The Lord is blameless for I have transgressed against his</b> Memra.” <b>Hear now all peoples,</b> the lamentations that Jeremiah made over Josiah <b>and see my affliction</b> that has come upon me after his death. <b>My virgins and young men have gone into exile.</b>"
Lamentations,1,19,"Jerusalem said, when she was delivered into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>“I called to my friends,</b> the sons of the nations, with whom I had made treaties to come to my aid. <b>But they deceived me</b> and turned to destroy me.

Lamentations,1,20,"“Look, O Lord, for I am in anguish. Therefore my bowels are piled up and my heart turns within me, for I have surely transgressed the decree of the Memra of the Lord. Consequently, <b>outside the sword bereaves and inside</b> the agony of starvation, <b>like</b> the Destroying Angel who is appointed over <b>death.</b>"
Lamentations,1,21,“The nations heard that I am groaning and there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies heard of the evil that overcame me and <b>were glad. For you Lord</b> are the one who <b>has done</b> it. <b>You have</b> caused them to <b>bring upon me a day of retribution.</b> You have summoned against me a coalition to destroy me. May you summon against them that <b>they may be</b> made desolate <b>like me.</b>
Lamentations,1,22,"“May there enter before you on the great judgment day <b>all their evil deeds</b> which they have done to me. <b>May you turn against them as you have turned against me because of my many rebellions, for my groans are many and my heart is weak.”</b>"
Lamentations,2,1,<b>How the Lord has detested the Congregation of Zion in his</b> fierce <b>anger. He threw down from the heavens to the earth the glory of Israel and he did not remember </b>the Temple that was<b> his footstool </b>nor did he spare it<b> in the day of his </b>fierce <b>anger.</b>
Lamentations,2,2,"<b>The Lord destroyed and did not spare any of the choice dwellings of the House of <b>Jacob. In his anger he destroyed the Congregation of the House of Judah and brought them to the ground. He broke the kingdom, crushed her leaders.</b></b>"
Lamentations,2,3,<b>In his fierce anger he cut off all the glory of Israel. He drew back his right hand and did not help his people <b>from before the enemy and he burned in the House of Jacob like a searing fire which consumes on all sides.</b></b>
Lamentations,2,4,"<b>He drew his bow</b> and shot arrows at me <b>like an enemy. He stood ready at the right </b>of Nebuchadnezzar and aided him <b>as if he </b>were<b> oppressing</b> his people, the House of Israel. <b>And he killed</b> every young man and <b>everything that was beautiful to see. In the tent of the Congregation of Zion he poured out</b> his anger <b>like a burning fire.</b>"
Lamentations,2,5,<b>The Lord has become like an enemy. He destroyed Israel. He destroyed all her forts and razed all her open cities. He has increased in the Congregation of<b> the House of Judah mourning and grief.</b></b>
Lamentations,2,6,<b>He uprooted his Temple like a garden. He razed the place appointed for the atonement of his people.<b> The Lord has caused </b>the joy of<b> the festival and the Sabbath to be forgotten and in his fierce anger he hates the king and</b> high <b>priest.</b></b>
Lamentations,2,7,<b>The Lord has abandoned the house of <b>his altar. He has trampled his Temple. He has handed over the walls of the forts to the enemy.

Lamentations,2,8,<b>The Lord resolved to destroy the wall of the Congregation of Zion. He swung the plummet and did not turn back his hand from destroying it. He caused the rampart and the wall to mourn; they were destroyed together.</b>
Lamentations,2,9,"<b>Her gates have sunk into the earth </b>because they slaughtered a pig and brought its blood over them. <b>He has destroyed and shattered her doorposts. Her king and rulers were exiled among the nations </b>because they did not keep the decrees of Torah, as if they had not received it on Mount Sinai. <b>Even her prophets</b> had the holy spirit of prophecy withheld from them and they <b>were not told a word</b> of prophecy <b>from </b>before<b> the Lord.</b>"
Lamentations,2,10,<b>The Elders of the Congregation of Zion sit on the ground in silence. They throw</b> wood<b>ashes upon their heads. They gird sackcloth</b> upon their bodies. <b>The virgins of Jerusalem bow their heads to </b>the dust of<b> the earth.</b>
Lamentations,2,11,"<b>My eyes are spent with tears, my bowels are piled up, my liver is spilt onto the ground because of the destruction of the Congregation of my people as youths and infants cried out in the open places of the cities.</b>"
Lamentations,2,12,"The young men of Israel <b>ask their mother, “Where is the bread and wine?” as they thirst</b> in the same way <b>as one wounded </b>by the sword suffers from thirst <b>in the open places of the cities, as their life is poured out</b> from hunger <b>into their mother’s bosom.</b>"
Lamentations,2,13,"<b>What can I bring to bear witness to you? Or to what can I compare you, O Congregation of Jerusalem?

Lamentations,2,14,"The false <b>prophets</b> within you, they <b>have seen falsehood for you</b> and there is <b>no substance</b> to their prophecies. <b>Nor did they make known</b> the punishment that would overtake you <b>as a result of your sin, in order to make you turn back in repentance. </b>Rather, <b>they prophesied to you vain prophecies and erring words.</b>"
Lamentations,2,15,"<b>All those who passed by the way clapped their hands at you.

Lamentations,2,16,"<b>All your enemies open their mouths at you. They hissed</b> with their lips <b>and gnashed their teeth and say, “We have destroyed! Surely this is the day we have waited for. We have found it; we have seen it.”</b>"
Lamentations,2,17,<b>The Lord has done what he planned.

Lamentations,2,18,"<b>The heart of Israel cried out before the Lord, to have mercy on them. <b>O wall of the city of Zion, weep tears like a torrent day and night. Give no </b>comfort to your sorrows, to<b> slacken </b>in the prayer that is<b> yours. May your eyes not cease </b>from weeping.</b>"
Lamentations,2,19,"<b>Arise, </b>O Congregation of Israel dwelling in exile.<b> Busy yourself </b>with Mishnah<b> in the night, </b>for the Shekinah of the Lord is dwelling before you, and with the words of Torah <b>at the beginning</b> of the morning <b>watch. Pour out like water </b>the crookedness of<b> your heart </b>and turn in repentance.

Lamentations,2,20,"<b>See, O Lord, and observe </b>from heaven<b> against whom you have turned. Thus is it </b>right for the <b>daughters</b> of Israel <b>to eat the fruit</b> of their wombs due to starvation, the lovely <b>boys wrapped</b> in fine linen? The Attribute of Justice replied, and said, <b>“Is it right to kill priest and prophet in the Temple of the LORD,</b> as when you killed Zechariah son of Iddo, the High Priest and faithful prophet in the Temple of the Lord on the Day of Atonement because he admonished you not to do evil before the Lord?”"
Lamentations,2,21,"<b>The young and the old </b>who were accustomed to recline on pillows of fine wool and upon ivory couches <b>were prostrate on the earth of the open markets. My virgins and youths have fallen, </b>killed<b> by the sword.

Lamentations,2,22,"<b>You will declare</b> freedom to your people, the House of Israel, by the hand of King Messiah just as you did by the hand of Moses and Aaron<b> on the day when you brought Israel up from Egypt. </b>My children will gather<b> all around, </b>from every place to which they had been scattered<b> in the day of your </b>fierce<b> anger, O Lord, and there was no escape for them nor any survivors </b>of those whom I had<b> wrapped </b>in fine linen.<b> And my enemies destroyed those whom I had raised </b>in royal comfort."
Lamentations,3,1,<b>I am </b>that <b>man who has seen affliction by the rod </b>that chastises in <b>his anger. </b>
Lamentations,3,2,"<b>He has led and brought me to darkness, and not to light.</b>"
Lamentations,3,3,"<b>Indeed, against me he will turn, heaping </b>upon <b>me his blows all day.</b>"
Lamentations,3,4,"<b>My flesh is worn out </b>from beatings, <b>my skin </b>from the blow. <b>He has shattered my bones.</b>"
Lamentations,3,5,<b>He has built </b>siege works <b>and surrounded </b>the city. He has uprooted <b>the heads </b>of the people <b>and wearied </b>them.
Lamentations,3,6,<b>He has caused me to dwell in a dark </b>prison <b>like the dead </b>who have gone to the other <b>world.</b>
Lamentations,3,7,<b>He has locked me in </b>so that <b>I cannot go out </b>from the prison. <b>He has put heavy brass </b>fetters on my feet.
Lamentations,3,8,<b>Even when I cry out and pray </b>the house of <b>my prayer is blocked.</b>
Lamentations,3,9,<b>He has closed my paths with hewn </b>marble <b>stones. He has confounded my paths.</b>
Lamentations,3,10,"<b>He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion </b>hiding <b>in a hallow.</b>"
Lamentations,3,11,<b>He has confounded my path and rent me. He has made me desolate.</b>
Lamentations,3,12,<b>He draws his bow and has set me as a target for the arrow.</b>
Lamentations,3,13,<b>He made the arrows of his quiver enter my vitals.</b>
Lamentations,3,14,<b>I have become a laughing stock to all </b>the degenerate <b>of my people; they mock me in song all day.</b>
Lamentations,3,15,<b>He has sated me with gall </b>of snakes <b>and made me drunk with wormwood.</b>
Lamentations,3,16,<b>And he crushed my teeth with gravel; he has pressed me into ashes.</b>
Lamentations,3,17,<b>And my soul shrinks from </b>asking for <b>peace; I have forgotten goodness.</b>
Lamentations,3,18,"<b>And I said, “My strength is destroyed and </b>the goodness which <b>I had longed for from </b>before <b>the Lord.</b>"
Lamentations,3,19,<b>“Remember the affliction </b>of my soul and how my foes <b>embittered </b>me and caused me to drink <b>wormwood </b>and the <b>poison</b> of snakes.”

Lamentations,3,23,He brings forth <b>new </b>wonders <b>in the mornings; great is your faithfulness.</b>
Lamentations,3,24,"<b>“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul; therefore I will hope in him.</b>"
Lamentations,3,25,<b>The Lord is good to those who hope </b>for his salvation; <b>to the soul who seeks his </b>instruction.<b></b>
Lamentations,3,26,<b>It is good to wait and be silent until the salvation of the Lord </b>comes.
Lamentations,3,27,<b>It is good for a man </b>to train his soul<b> to bear the yoke </b>of the commandments <b>in his youth.</b>
Lamentations,3,28,"<b>Let him sit alone and be silent, bearing </b>the corrections which have come <b>upon him,</b> for the sake of the unity of the name of the Lord, which have been sent to punish him for the minor sins which he has committed in this world, until he have mercy upon him and lift them from him so that he may receive him perfected in the world to come."
Lamentations,3,29,<b>Let him put his mouth to the dust </b>and prostrate himself before his master <b>perhaps there is hope.</b>
Lamentations,3,30,"<b>Let him turn his cheek to the one that smites, </b>for the sake of the fear of the Lord, <b>let him be filled with insult.</b>"
Lamentations,3,31,"<b>For the Lord will not neglect </b>his servants <b>forever, </b>giving them over into the hand of their enemy."
Lamentations,3,32,<b>But </b>first <b>he breaks </b>and afterwards he repents and <b>has mercy </b>on the righteous <b>in the abundance of his goodness.</b>
Lamentations,3,33,"<b>For </b>since man did not <b>afflict </b>his soul nor removed arrogance <b>from his heart, </b>therefore <b>he </b>caused <b>destruction </b>to come <b>upon the sons of men.</b>"
Lamentations,3,34,"<b>Humbling </b>and subduing <b>all the prisoners of the earth under his feet,</b>"

Lamentations,3,38,"<b>From the mouth of God Most High there does not issue evil,</b> rather by the hint of a whisper, because of the violence with which the land is filled. But when he desires to decree <b>good i</b>n the world it issues from the holy mouth."
Lamentations,3,39,<b>What profit shall a man </b>find who sins all the days of <b>his life; </b>a wicked <b>man for his sins?</b>
Lamentations,3,40,<b>Let us search and examine our ways; and turn </b>in repentance <b>before the Lord.</b>
Lamentations,3,41,<b>Let us lift our </b>cleansed <b>hearts </b>and cast away theft and robbery from <b>our hands. </b>And let us repent <b>before God</b> the dwelling of whose Shekinah is <b>in heaven</b> above.
Lamentations,3,42,"<b>We have rebelled and been disobedient </b>and since we did not return to you, <b>you have not forgiven.</b>"
Lamentations,3,43,<b>You have covered </b>us <b>in anger and pursued us </b>in exile. <b>You have killed and have not pitied.</b>

Lamentations,3,45,<b>You have made us like wanderers and vagabonds among the nations.</b>
Lamentations,3,46,"<b>All our enemies have opened their mouths against us, </b>to announce evil decrees against us."
Lamentations,3,47,"<b>Panic and fear have come upon us </b>because of them, <b>trembling and destruction </b>have seized us."
Lamentations,3,48,Like <b>streams of water my eyes flowed</b> with tears <b>because of the destruction of the Congregation of my people.</b>
Lamentations,3,49,<b>My eye weeps </b>tears <b>and does not cease </b>from crying. <b>There is no respite </b>from my anguish or anyone to comfort me;

Lamentations,3,52,"<b>My enemies, without cause, laid a trap for me like a bird.</b>"
Lamentations,3,53,<b>They caused my life to pass in the pit and cast stones at me.</b>
Lamentations,3,54,"<b>Waters flowed over my head. I said </b>in my word, <b>“I am cut off </b>from the world.”"
Lamentations,3,55,"<b>I prayed to your name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit.</b>"

Lamentations,3,57,"<b>You brought </b>the angel <b>near </b>to save me, <b>in the day that I prayed to you. You said </b>by your Memra, <b>“Do not fear.”</b>"
Lamentations,3,58,"<b>You have fought, O Lord, </b>against those who made <b>a quarrel with my soul. You delivered my life </b>from their hands."

Lamentations,3,65,<b>May you give them brokenness of heart and may your </b>weariness <b>wear them out.</b>
Lamentations,3,66,<b>Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the </b>high <b>heaven of the Lord.</b>
Lamentations,4,1,"<b>How the gold </b>of the Temple <b>has dimmed, the choice gold leaf has changed! The sacred jewels are scattered at the head of every street.</b>"
Lamentations,4,2,"<b>The precious sons of Zion which were comparable </b>in their appearance to that of fine <b>gold, </b>how the unclean people brought them down near to their beds and stare at them, so that their wives might bear sons as beautiful as they and <b>they are considered as clay vessels the work of the hands of the potter.</b>"
Lamentations,4,3,<b>Even </b>the pampered daughters of Israel <b>untie their breasts </b>to the nations who are like <b>the basilisk. And the young men of the Congregation of my people </b>are handed over to <b>cruel men </b>and their mothers mourn over them <b>like ostriches in the desert.</b>
Lamentations,4,4,"<b>The tongue of the youth clings to his palate from thirst. Children ask for bread, but there is no one who offers it to them.</b>"
Lamentations,4,5,<b> Those who </b>used to <b>eat delicacies were desolate in the markets. Those who were reared in </b>the color <b>crimson embrace dunghills.</b>
Lamentations,4,6,"<b>The sin of the Congregation of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom that was overthrown in a moment. And no </b>prophets <b>were left in her </b>to prophesy, to turn her back in <b>repentance.</b>"
Lamentations,4,7,"<b>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, smoother than milk. Their appearance was ruddier than crimson and their faces </b>like <b>sapphires.</b>"
Lamentations,4,8,<b>Their appearance was darker than the blackness </b>of the exile; <b>they were not recognized in the markets. Their skin clung to their bones; brittle as a twig.</b>
Lamentations,4,9,"<b>Better were those who were slain by the sword than those who were slain by hunger, </b>for those slain by the sword <b>perished when pierced </b>in their bellies because they ate of <b>the gleanings of the field; </b>and those who were bloated from hunger; their bellies burst from food."
Lamentations,4,10,"<b>The hands of women </b>who were <b>merciful </b>towards the poor <b>boiled their young, they became sustenance for them when </b>the day of famine <b>broke, </b>when <b>the Congregation of my people </b>was destroyed."

Lamentations,4,13,"The Attribute of Justice spoke up and said, “All this would not have happened but <b>for the sins of her prophets </b>who prophesied to her false prophesies <b>and the iniquity of her priests </b>who offered up burning incense to idols.

Lamentations,4,14,"<b>The blind wandered about in the markets, defiled with the blood </b>of those slain by the sword and since <b>they could not</b>see <b>they touched their clothes.</b>"
Lamentations,4,15,"<b>“Turn away from the unclean!” cried </b>the nations, <b>“Turn away, turn away! Do not touch them!” For they quarreled, indeed they wandered. They said, </b>when they were peacefully established <b>among the nations, “They shall not continue to dwell here.”</b>"
Lamentations,4,16,"<b>They were dispersed </b>from before <b>the face of the Lord, he no longer regarded them. </b>Therefore the wicked peoples <b>did not respect the priests nor did they spare the elders.</b>"
Lamentations,4,17,"<b>Our eyes still fail to see our help </b>which we expected to come from the Romans, but which turned <b>to naught</b> for us. <b>In hope we watched for the </b>Edomites who were a <b>nation that could not save.</b>"
Lamentations,4,18,"<b>They prowled our paths so that we could not walk </b>safely <b>in our open places. </b>We said, <b>“Our end is near; our days are fulfilled,” for our end had come.</b>"

Lamentations,5,4,<b>We drink our water for money and our wood comes at a price.<b></b></b>
Lamentations,5,5,<b>Upon </b>the bone of <b>our necks we were laden </b>when we went into exile.
