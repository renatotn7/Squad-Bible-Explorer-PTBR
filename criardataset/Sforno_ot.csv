Genesis,1,1,"['בראשית, at the beginning of time; this is the first moment which is indivisible into shorter periods. There had not been a concept “time” previous to this, i.e. there had only been unbroken continuity. [The author perceives “time” as one of the creations. Ed.]', 'ברא, He had converted “nothing” into “something.” There had been no need to invoke “time” in order to accomplish this.', 'אלוקים, The expression “elo-ha” refers to something enduring, eternal. This is why Moses (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:17"">Deut. 32,17</a>) refers to demons, שדים, as לא אלו-ה, seeing that they are not eternal, are subject to death as our sages taught (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Chagigah.16"" data-ref=""Chagigah 16"">Chagigah 16</a>) The reason that the term “elo-ha” here appears in the plural mode, i.e. “elo-him,” is to teach us that G’d is the origin of all the various visible and invisible manifestations in the universe. This is what the prophet (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.6.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 6:3"">Isaiah 6,3</a>) has in mind when he described G’d as מלא כל הארץ כבודו, “the entire globe is a manifestation of His glory.” There is no other existence unless it has emanated from His existence. This is what <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Nehemiah.9.6"" data-ref=""Nehemiah 9:6"">Nechemyah 9,6</a> had in mind when he said ואתה מחיה את כלם, “You provide life for all of them.” When speaking of “appearances,” every phenomenon which is abstract as distinct from being tangible, is described by the generic term אלוקים. Professional, i.e. expert judges are called אלוהים, as they are able to pronounce judgment בצלם אלוקים, reflecting Divine wisdom. Their very profession is testimony to something enduring, divine in nature.', 'את השמים, the word שם refers to a place which is distant, as opposed to the word פה, which means “here.” Every plural mode when accompanied by an accented penultimate syllable vocalised with a patach signals 2 of something which are equi-distant from all sides. This is something possible only in connection with an orbiting planet. This is something which is not possible, i.e that two points are equidistant from the center unless they are part of an orbiting spherical planet. The Torah therefore says that G’d created the phenomenon which at this time is far distant from us in such a way that all its sides are equi-distant from us, in other words the phenomenon is a planet, something spherical.', 'ואת הארץ, and the center which is orbited by the planet.']"
Genesis, 1,2,"['והארץ היתה תהו ובהו, “this very center which was created at that time was composed of a mixture of raw materials, known as tohu, and its original external appearance is what is described as bohu. The reason is that the whole expanse of tohu was comprised of a uniform appearance. This explained that the first raw material was something entirely new. It is described as tohu to indicate that at that point it was merely something which had potential, the potential not yet having materialised, been converted to something actual. When we read in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.12.21"" data-ref=""I Samuel 12:21"">Samuel I 12,21</a> כי תהו המה, the meaning is that these phenomena did not exist in reality, they existed only in someone’s imagination. [a reference to pagan deities. Ed.] The appearance of this primordial raw material is described as bohu, meaning that as such it came to exist in actual fact, in real terms. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.34.11"" data-ref=""Isaiah 34:11"">Isaiah 34,11</a> “weights of emptiness.” This describes any phenomenon that does not retain its appearance for any length of time. It constantly changes like a chameleon.', 'וחשך, a reference to the air (atmosphere, totally dark which emanated at that time from the original raw material. על פני תהום, over the expanse of the two basic foundations which also emanated from the same origin and surrounded one another.', 'ורוח אלוקים, the energy propelling the planet is called ruach,” as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.4"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:4"">Psalms 104,4</a> עושה מלאכיו רוחות, “He energises His messengers.”', 'מרחפת על פני המים, they activated the atmosphere above the waters which at that time surrounded the earth. This is the reason why the part which was closer to the spherical planet became incandescent through its motion [friction. Ed.] This phenomenon is what we know as the original fire. On the other hand, the part of the energy which remained closer to the waters acquired a degree of frigidity from the proximity to the waters, so that only a small part of the atmosphere really became hot through revolving and giving off sparks of fiery light. ']"
Genesis, 1,3,"['""Let there be light"" - this is the light of the seven days [i.e., <i>Or HaGanuz</i>], which was for the use of those created without seed, and it will be [again] in the future, as the words of the Sages (may their memories be a blessing) <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.30b"" data-ref=""Shabbat 30b"">Shabbat 30b</a>:  it will then be for that which is the future will ""bring forth baked treats and fine clothing"" without [needing] the power of seed.']"
Genesis, 1,4,"['וירא אלוקים את האור כי טוב, This describes the reason why G’d created the light, not that He “saw”” something new which He had not been aware of previously. It was because it was “good,” that G’d had created the light.', 'ויבדל אלוקים בין האור ובין החשך, the days (prior to the fourth day when the sun was placed in orbit) during which use was made of the “original light,” periods of light and darkness alternated due to causes other than the revolving of the planet around its own axis, i.e. due to the direct expression of G’d’s desire. He ensured that periods of light alternated with periods of darkness.']"
Genesis, 1,5,"['ויקרא אלוקים לאור יום; even though at that stage of creation “time” was not yet an operative term as we know it nowadays, i.e. the terms “day” and “night” were not yet used by anyone, G’d named these phenomena as such already at that time.', 'ויהי ערב ויהי בקר, although G’d had made a separation between the light and the darkness, assigning to each different time frames in which to be active, independent of the planet earth revolving on its axis, He arranged for a transition from one phenomenon to the other to take place gradually, step by step. This occurred by means of inserting a period known as evening preceding total night, and a period of dawn preceding bright sunlight, daylight.']"
Genesis, 1,6,"['יהי רקיע בתוך המים, let there be טבע, i.e. guidelines, rules governing the function of what is below and what is above the primordial waters. Just as there are such parameters surrounding our world, i.e. the globe we call “earth,” so there should be similar guidelines governing what is below the atmosphere and earth itself. The region in which air exists should become clearly defined. [the gaseous nature of air should not be allowed to escape into all directions of the universe beyond our globe so that creatures on earth would die from the lack of air. In other words, the atmosphere should be “enclosed” whether by gravitational or other forces is immaterial. Ed.] At the same time, air should be given enough space within which “to breathe,” so to speak.']"
Genesis, 1,7,"['""And G-d made the firmament"" - and it was that when some of the elemental water was removed from under that part of the waters which became vaporous in nature, as it was when He said, ""let the waters be gathered from beneath the heavens"" <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.9"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:9"">Genesis 1:9</a>, it was fit that the vaporous part would descend to that same place from which the that [non-vaporous portion of] waters was removed. But He made it such that that ""firmament"" that separates would have the power to stop and prevent the vaporous portion from descending - that\'s the ""waters which are above the firmament"", such that the transformed atmospheric portion would descend, while the vaporous would remain in its original place. Because of this, when the moist vapor reaches it [i.e., the firmament], it condenses and gives rise to rain, snow and hail. As they condense they descend, as it is said, ""at the sound of His placing an abundance of water in the heavens"" <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.10.13"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 10:13"">Jeremiah 10:13</a>. - what it wanted by saying ""heavens"": the  firmament which condenses the atmospheric part [of the waters], as it is said ""And G-d called the firmament ""heavens"" <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.8"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:8"">Genesis 1:8</a>. Now when the cloudy, excited vapor arrives there [at the firmament], it generates thunder and lightning, and it is said: ""He lifts up clouds from the ends of the earth, thunder from the rain He makes"" [continuation of verse quoted previously from Jeremiah]. Now, seeing as how some of the heavier watery element is above the lighter air, which from our perspectives is against their nature - this without doubt indicates the action of an volitional actor, intended such an outcome, as it is said, ""the work of His hands shall the firmament declare"" <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.19.2"" data-ref=""Psalms 19:2"">Psalms 19:2</a>', '""and it was so"" - it remained thus against its nature.']"
Genesis, 1,8,"['ויקרא אלוקים לרקיע שמים. Seeing that activities occurring in the celestial regions reach us by means of G’d’s agents and not directly, the Torah had to tell us that G’d named the phenomenon, otherwise we would not have known this, [would have considered it as a result of an evolutionary process. Ed.] We know of this indirect activity of G’d when the Torah referred (verses 17-18) to “G’d placed them (the luminaries) in the רקיע השמים, and assigned to them the task to illuminate the earth, etc.”']"
Genesis, 1,9,"['יקוו המים; this does not mean that the waters should dry up, as many people interpreted it. These people said that the process would be achieved by a substantial part of the oceans freezing and turning to ice such as the polar regions, and that this would be caused by forces in the celestial regions. אל מקום אחד. The waters should not deviate from this location. As a result they became much higher than the surrounding land mass without crashing down on earth as our senses would have us think would be the case. This is why David tells us in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:9"">Psalms 104,9</a>: גבול שמת בל יעברון, “You have set them limits which they must not cross.” The meaning is that the waters must not flood the earth.” ']"
Genesis, 1,10,"['ויקרא אלוקים ליבשה ארץ, G’d assigned a name which is applicable to the whole also to parts of it. The reason is that the particular part of the “earth” described previously as merely יבשה, is in reality the most important and productive part of the “earth.” (based on Moreh Nevuchim) Isaiah 45,18 already referred to this when he said of earth that לשבת יצרה, “G’d formed it in order that it be populated,” i.e. subterranean earth is of secondary importance, seeing one cannot cultivate it and make it one’s habitat.', '""and G-d saw that it was good"" - He wanted it thus because of the goal which is: the intended Goodness']"
Genesis, 1,11,"['דשא, herbs fit for consumption by animals. We find this expression used in this sense in Yoel 2,22כי דשאו נאות מדבר, “for its herbs (the ones for the beasts) are found in the pastures of the wilderness.”', 'עשב מזריע זרע, for consumption by human beings.', 'עץ פרי עושה פרי למינו, if it were a mixture of more than one species it would not be able to reproduce itself.', 'ויהי כן, it endured, in its original format, not becoming adulterated nor shedding any of its individuality. Had it absorbed parts of competing species it could not have procreated itself.']"
Genesis, 1,14,"['יהי מאורות ברקיע השמים, the planets created on the second day should now begin to function by providing light. Their influence should be concentrated on the “lower” universe, as it is visible to us with our senses. Everything mentioned in this paragraph refers to sensations perceived by the creatures on earth. By traversing pure waters on the way to earth, the light refracted by these luminaries is increased manifold.']"
Genesis, 1,15,"['להאיר על הארץ, they should dispense their light at a time when it is beneficial for the inhabitants of the earth.', 'ויהי כן, G’d’s directive was executed and became a permanent feature of natural law.']"
Genesis, 1,16,"['ויעש...ויתן...להאיר...ולמשול..ולהבדיל..כי טוב, all of these expressions refer to the luminaries and the other stars. The Torah first writes: ויעש, seeing that up until that point sun and moon had simply been part of all the other celestial bodies which had been created on the second day, or of “heaven,” whose creation had already been reported in verse 1. This is the reason why at this stage the Torah does not call the development of these luminaries an act of creation, ויברא or something similar, but merely writes ויעש, which describes the completion of a process that had already been begun previously. At this stage, G’d singled out these two luminaries from among all the planets and assigned them their function', 'The word כי טוב, “that it was good,” describes G’d’s impression after He had removed these luminaries from their original place in the universe, given them spherical shape so that they can orbit, and function as luminaries.']"
Genesis, 1,18,"['ולמשול ביום ובלילה, in order to bring new creatures into life in the “lower” regions of the universe, i.e. these living creatures, as opposed to the plants, required more than the light G’d had created on the first day. Seeing they are more important and more sophisticated beings they require exposure to better light in order to flourish.', 'ולהבדיל בין האור ובין החושך, to establish clear demarcations amongst the inhabitants of the lower regions of the universe, between when these respective luminaries were to shine, and when they were to set, i.e. to disappear from view. Basically, the meaning is the same as in verse 14 above.']"
Genesis, 1,20,"['יעופף על הארץ על פני רקיע השמים, in order to cleanse the air of the atmosphere for the benefit of the inhabitants of the earth from any excessive moisture in the air which had resulted through the creation of the rakia on the second “day.”']"
Genesis, 1,21,"['ויברא אלוקים את התנינים, the evolutionary powers of the waters did not suffice for this task. They could not produce the original sea-monsters without having been provided for this with seed by the Creator.']"
Genesis, 1,22,"['ויברך אותם אלוקים, seeing there were so many of them they would not achieve their purpose in this universe without such a Divine blessing.']"
Genesis, 1,24,"['תוצא הארץ נפש חיה, earth should produce living creatures possessing a quality of life superior to that of the plants.', 'ויהי כן, it was exactly so, i.e. without omissions or additions. If any of the components of these creatures (genes) were to be missing, they would lose the ability to procreate in kind.']"
Genesis, 1,25,['“And G-d made the beasts of the earth according to their kind” – He gave to each species senses and capacities in accordance with what was necessary for that species.']
Genesis, 1,26,"['ויאמר אלוקים נעשה, at this point G’d endowed His entourage to carry out the task assigned to it.', 'אדם, another one of the species referred to as נפש חיה, one known as אדם. This is why we read in Genesis 2,7 ויהי האדם לנפש חיה, “Adam became one of the species known as נפש חיה.”', 'בצלמנו, a species designed to live forever seeing that it is predominantly intellectual. By doing this, G’d provided an opening by means of His Torah to acquire an understanding of the nature of purely spiritual, disembodied beings such as angels. Our soul has been given the key to understand something about the nature of such beings.', 'כדמותנו, acting intelligently like the angels, though from free choice, not like the angels who act under Divine compulsion. In this respect, though the angels are celestial beings, they do not resemble man. In this respect man is a little more like G’d Himself than are the angels, though our habitat is in the “lower” regions of the universe. The principal difference between G’d’s total freedom of action and that of man’s is that G’d’s freedom of action is always put to a constructive use, whereas man frequently abuses his G’d given freedom to oppose the expressed will of His Creator. At any rate, not being hampered by the limitations imposed by having a body, the qualitative freedom of G’d is far superior to that of man, and this is why the Torah uses the comparative כדמותנו, to show that the comparison is limited.']"
Genesis, 1,27,"['בצלם אלוקים, when the word אלוקים appears as a description, i.e. in the nature of an adjective, it refers to creatures who are spiritual in their essence, not just that they possess spiritual potential. Such beings are devoid of such physical matter, are totally disembodied. This is what makes them basically infinite. This is the reason why such an adjective, attribute, is applied to G’d as well as to His angels. The term is also used in connection with judges, i.e. describing the predominating intellectual function they must perform if their decisions are to reflect true justice. Whereas it is an undisputed fact that the human intellect operates without direct dependence on any part of the body, that it does not age along with the remainder of the body it inhabits, but, on the contrary, sometimes improves while the body ages and becomes barely able to sustain the soul which inhabits it, and while it is also a fact that exercise of the intellect does not result in fatigue, etc, it is still not called אלוקים, something divine, but only צלם אלוקים, “something which mirrors something divine.” Until this intellect has acquired חכמה, i.e. a reverence for G’d and love for Him, its Creator, it is completely imperfect. It follows that it is man’s task to perfect his G’d given intelligence by acquiring the knowledge and insights which can be provided only by the study of Torah and by the practice of the laws of the Torah. If man, i.e. religiously atheistic intellectuals, do not use their intellect in the manner G’d meant for them to use it, it actually becomes a negative asset, a hindrance, so that in the end it turns out to be completely vain, as pointed out in Psalms 49,21 אדם ביקר ולא יבין נמשל כבהמות ידמו, “if man does not understand the divine gift his intellect represents he is comparable to the beasts which perish.” This entire lesson is condensed in the two words בצלם אלוקים.']"
Genesis, 1,28,"['וכבשה, this is not a directive to conquer earth with muscular power, but to subdue it by means of man’s superior intellect. It means that man is to use his intelligence to prevent predators from invading his habitats, demonstrating the fact that man is superior, can outwit the beasts.', 'ורדו, trapping the beasts, training them to bend to man’s will.']"
Genesis, 1,29,"['הנה נתתי לכם, as food to be consumed by man.']"
Genesis, 1,30,"['ולכל חית הארץ, but to all the beasts on earth including the birds and the domesticated animals I have allocated את כל ירק עשב, different kinds of herbs which are not generating seed.']"
Genesis, 1,31,"['את כל אשר עשה והנה טוב מאד, the accomplishment of a project containing many different parts is greater than the accomplishment of each part of such project successfully. Now that G’d had completed the entire project successfully, the Torah described this with the additional word מאד instead of merely טוב. ', 'יום הששי, this is the first day which is described as “the (sixth) day.” In other words, it was the first of many days known as “the sixth,” but this was the first such day. The specific function of the sixth day is to be the bridge between the ordinary weekdays and the Sabbath. The “six” days have been defined in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.9-10"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:9-10"">Exodus 20,9-10</a> as the days on which “you will perform all your tasks involving work.”']"
Genesis, 2,1,"[' ויכלו, when all the phenomena intended to comprise the physical universe had materialised ']"
Genesis, 2,2,"['ויכל אלוקים ביום השביעי, at the beginning of the seventh “day,” a moment which is indivisible from the time frame which follows, so that both the six previous “days” were an entity in themselves, and the seventh day was a totally self-contained entity. Our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bereishit_Rabbah.10.9"" data-ref=""Bereishit Rabbah 10:9"">Bereshit Rabbah 10,9</a> describe G’d as knowing the precise moment between the sixth and seventh day and describe it as “thin as a hair’s breadth.” [I believe the problem confronting the sages was the statement that G’d had completed all His work in the six days, and yet the Torah speaks of Him completing, ויכל, His work on the ”seventh” day, something that appears to be a contradiction to the former statement. Ed.] ', 'וישבות ביום השביעי, G’d’s inactivity on the seventh day set it apart from the previous six days.']"
Genesis, 2,3,"['ויברך אלוקים את יום השביעי, this refers not only to the first Sabbath but to all subsequent Sabbath days. G’d endowed every Sabbath with this blessing so that it would more readily accommodate the additional “soul” He grants Jews on that day. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.33.30"" data-ref=""Job 33:30"">Job 33,30</a> describes this phenomenon as לאור באור החיים, “designed that he may bask in the light of life.” Our sages (Beytzah 16) state that the words שבת וינפש in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.31.17"" data-ref=""Exodus 31:17"">Exodus 31,17</a> refer to the loss of this additional soul at the end of the Sabbath. ']"
Genesis, 2,4,"['אלה תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם. These are the plants and the living creatures which had been the potential derivatives of heaven and earth already at the time when heaven and earth were first created. The potential ability for heaven and earth to produce the inhabitants of their respective domains was inherent in their respective composition from the first moment of their existence. When the Torah, in its very first verse, wrote the words את השמים and את הארץ, this was already an allusion to the additional factors which had been created together with heaven and earth, i.e. their ability to produce their respective derivatives.', ""ביום עשות ה' אלוקים ארץ ושמים, this potential was translated into an actual only on the day when G’d completed עשות, i.e. arranged in detail how these derivatives were to function and where and when. This occurred after the six “days” of creative activity. Only when that stage had been reached was G’d referred to in the Torah by His full name, i.e. ה' אלוקים.""]"
Genesis, 2,5,"['טרם יהיה בארץ, these words emphasise that although all phenomena had been created, this referred to their potential, not to their functioning as they do nowadays. כל עשב השדה, had not yet sprouted,', 'כי לא המטיר, for G’d had not yet made it rain in such a fashion that it enabled the latent power of these plants to fully develop.']"
Genesis, 2,6,"['ואד יעלה מן הארץ, on the day they were completed, i.e. at the end of the sixth “day” a vapour rose from the earth equivalent to beneficial dew which irrigated the earth and enabled it to bring forth further vegetation without the help of rain or man’s labour.']"
Genesis, 2,7,"[""וייצר ה' אלוקים, the animals had not rated involvement of both attributes of G’d in their creation and formation. Not only that, but in order to create man G’d had used עפר מן האדמה, the choicest of the dust available on earth. Moreover,"", 'ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים, G’d personally blew a soul of life into man, a life force which had been readied to absorb what was previously called צלם אלוקים, “the image of G’d.” This has been attested to in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.32.8"" data-ref=""Job 32:8"">Job 32,8</a> ונשמת שדי תבינם,”by means of the breath of the attribute of Shaddai You endowed them with understanding.” At any rate, ויהי האדם לנפש חיה, man had remained a living creature (similar to the animals) until You equipped him with a divine-like tzelem and demut.']"
Genesis, 2,8,"['אשר יצר, after G’d had created man in a manner appropriate to his superior status on earth, He placed him in Gan Eden, a location which was suitable to equip him with the צלם אלוקים, the divine image, enabling him to also fulfill the intellectual tasks involving the air and food in the garden.']"
Genesis, 2,9,"['ויצמח, G‘d made the food necessary for Adam sprout forth. The verse illustrates with what ease Adam could secure his requirements in Gan Eden.', 'נחמד למראה, looking at these trees resulted In the viewer experiencing intellectual stimulation both of his heart and his brain. He would thus be capable of “digesting” the additional intellectual insights granted him by G’d. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.3.15"" data-ref=""II Kings 3:15"">Kings II 3,15</a> ותהי עליו יד ה\', “Elisha had now been endowed by G’d’s generosity.” [a reference to the additional spiritual insights he had asked from his mentor Elijah prior to the latter ascending to heaven. Ed.]', 'ועץ הדעת, a tree whose fruit results in those who eat from it gaining greater understanding of the relationship of good and evil. The word דעת, which appears here for the first time, helps us understand <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.4.1"" data-ref=""Genesis 4:1"">Genesis 4,1</a> והאדם ידע את חוה אשתו. Without this verse we would have been puzzled by the Torah telling us something that was so obvious. Who does not “know” his wife, especially when he had described her as “bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh!” (2,23) In our verse we are told that the words ידע, דעת do not primarily refer to factual knowledge but to conceptual knowledge. This also helps us to understand why relatives, as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ruth.2.1"" data-ref=""Ruth 2:1"">Ruth 2,1</a> are referred to as מודע לאישה, “someone whom her late husband had been intimate with, had been related to by blood.” It is normal for blood relations to be concerned with the physical and emotional needs of their kin. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.17.17"" data-ref=""Proverbs 17:17"">Proverbs 17,17</a>.)', 'טוב ורע, to choose that which appeared as appealing to the senses even though it would prove harmful, and to despise anything which did not appeal to his senses although he knew it to be useful to him.']"
Genesis, 2,10,"['ונהר יוצא מעדן, the Torah explains that Adam’s work did not entail anything strenuous, such as carrying pails of water, or such as getting wet in the rain.']"
Genesis, 2,11,"['שם אחד פישון, [The Torah] informed us of the praise of the river that irrigates the garden that is not known to us by informing us of the rivers that branch off from it that are known by their praised size and the goodness of their water and the goodness of their fruit.']"
Genesis, 2,15,"['לעבדה, a reference to perfecting his own personality, that which was supplied by G’d in an as yet unrefined state, the one called נשמת חיים. [the author searched to justify the use of the feminine mode in the word לעבדה and related it to נשמה, soul, a noun which is feminine and requires further refinement, just like שיר and שירה which both mean song, the latter, in the feminine mode being unrefined when compared to the former. Compare its use in the haggadah shel Pessach. Ed.]', 'ולשמרה, eating the fruit of the garden would ensure that man’s natural juices would not dry up. Man is equipped with natural heat, and if not supplied with the proper kind of nourishment he may dehydrate. The excellent fruit of the trees of the garden would replenish loss of moisture through evaporation on the skin in the heat of the sun.']"
Genesis, 2,16,"['מכל עץ הגן, depending on which tree’s fruit was in season. Each season required nutrients appropriate to the prevailing climate, and the fruit ripening during the various seasons would provide man with these nutrients. The prophet Ezekiel 74,12 expresses this thought in the words לחדשיו יבכר “in its appropriate month it will yield new fruit.”']"
Genesis, 2,17,"['ומעץ הדעת, the tree in the middle of the garden, in close proximity to the tree of life mentioned previously (verse 9) The meaning of חיים in connection with that tree is equivalent to the meaning of the words in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.30.19"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 30:19"">Deuteronomy 30:19</a> החיים והמות נתתי לפניך, “I have placed life and death (to choose) before you.” [we may understand this to mean that the tree of life, if its fruit were eaten, would result in life of infinite duration, whereas eating from the tree next to it would result in life being shortened. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 2,18,"['לא טוב היות האדם לבדו, the purpose of the human species on earth will not be achieved while man who is supposed to reflect the divine image will be left to personally carry out all the menial tasks of daily life on earth by being solitary.', 'עזר כנגדו, a helpmate who will be equal to him, also reflecting the divine image. This is essential for him if he is to know what precisely his needs are and so that he can meet them in time. The reason why the Torah added the word כנגדו is that whenever one confronts someone of equal power, moral and ethical weight, such a confrontation is termed נגד. It is a head-on collision of will. When the two parties disagreeing are not of equal power, or moral/ethical weight, the confrontation is termed as one being עולה or יורד one of the adversaries either prevailing or losing in such an encounter. It is in this sense that we have to understand such statements as משה שקול כנגד כל ישראל, “that Moses was the equal of the entire Jewish people.” (Mechilta Yitro 1) However, the Torah did not mean for woman to be 100% equal to man, else how could the man expect her to perform household chores for him, etc.? Hence the letter כ at the beginning of the word כנגדו somewhat tones down this equality.']"
Genesis, 2,19,"[""ויצר ה' אלוקים מן האדמה כל חית השדה, G’d now provided these creatures with their final shape, putting the “finishing touches” on them, so to speak. At that stage of the earth’s condition, the original product which the earth had produced, not based on seed which contains all the genetic material in microscopic form, was not adequate to produce the final product without input by G’d, personally."", 'ויבא אל האדם, in order for man to realise there was a need for an additional phenomenon, seeing that amongst the existing ones none met his need for a partner.', 'לראות מה יקרא לו, so that he would see which name would be appropriate for each creature, based on the specific tasks they performed in the universe.', 'נפש חיה הוא שמו, its name would provide all of us with a clue as to its function in G’d’s scheme of things. The essence of each animal, נפש, would be revealed by its activity on earth.']"
Genesis, 2,22,"[""ויבן ה' אלוקים את הצלע לאשה, it was someone possessing the features of a human being, much like those of a man. She would be different from man only in some external physical features. She would possess the same ability to perfect her personality as did man.""]"
Genesis, 2,23,"['זאת, this female ', 'הפעם הזאת, finally, this time עצם מעצמי ובשר מבשרי, only this time, seeing that all females of the future will not be fashioned by the male undergoing such type of surgery.', 'לזאת יקרא אשה, all other female human beings in the future will be known as אשה, ', 'even though they will not, like this time, be literally part of the flesh of their husbands.', 'כי מאיש לוקחה זאת, “this one,” the first woman ever.']"
Genesis, 2,24,"['על כן, seeing that on this first occasion G’d had aimed to make Adam’s wife as much part of him as possible, so that he even used Adam’s personal body as Chavah’s basic skeleton, ', 'יעזוב איש את אביו ואת אמו ודבק באשתו, it is appropriate that a man leave the home of his parents in order to acquire a wife who is compatible with him, and who is a suitable mate for him to live with on a permanent basis. The Torah teaches here also that the expression דיבוק, “cleaving,” being in a state of true union, is not possible between two people who are not alike in their common purpose in life. Parents and children do not have the same tasks and challenges. Man and his wife do have to master the same challenges, hence the word “union” can be applied to their union, whereas the same word would be inappropriate for describing the relationship between father and son, or mother and son. By living together they will become of one mind on how to deal with their lives’ challenges.', ' והיו לבשר אחד, they are to work together in such close union as if there were in fact only one of them. (This had been the idea behind creating man as both male and female in the first place.)']"
Genesis, 2,25,"['<b>And they were not ashamed.</b> They used their limbs solely for the service of their Maker, not the pursuit of base pleasures. Therefore they considered marital relations no different than eating and drinking and their reproductive organs no different than their mouth or hands.']"
Genesis, 3,1,"['והנחש, another word for Satan, which itself is a way of describing the evil urge. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bava_Batra.16"" data-ref=""Bava Batra 16"">Baba Batra 16</a>). The reason why this evil urge is compared to a serpent is that just like a serpent which makes itself as invisible as possible, blending in with its environment, and yet causes more damage than the most prominently visible obstacles, so the evil urge lurks where one does not suspect to find it. It is a common practice to name phenomena according to other well known phenomena, such as calling the king “lion,” to show what is expected of a king, i.e. strength, fearlessness, etc. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.4.7"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 4:7"">Jeremiah 4,7</a> “the lion has come up from his thicket,” a reference to King Nevuchadnezzar) Also in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.8.17"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 8:17"">Jeremiah 8,17</a> Israel’s enemies are referred to as נחשים צפעונים אשר אין להם לחש, “adders which cannot be charmed.” G’d, using a metaphor, calls the evil urge נחש, in our verse. Anything or anybody who leads Israel into sin is termed נחש. The reason why a serpent has been chosen for such a metaphor is that it is a creature whose potential harm is huge, whereas its potential benefit to man is minimal. Moreover, seeing that its visibility is minimal, it is similar to the evil urge who never attacks frontally, and often poses as friend rather than as enemy. Our sages in Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 13 already enlarged on this metaphor by describing Samael as riding the serpent, meaning “taking advantage of this power of imagination.” The insidious nature of the evil urge consists of the fact that it conjures up in our imagination something desirable, which because of its desirability we rationalize into considering as harmless, harbouring no physical or spiritual danger for us. Greed, lust, combined with one’s imagination is a powerful tool for leading man into sin. Unless man is able to harness the power of reason against such insidious attempts to trick him into disobedience against G’d by giving in to his desire for gratification of his senses, he will fall victim to the evil urge’s machinations. When our sages (Jerusalem Talmud <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.8"" data-ref=""Mishnah Berakhot 1:8"">Berachot 1.8</a>) said עינא ולבא סרסורי דחטאה, “the eyes and the heart are agents of sin,” they referred to the warning against the evil urge we recite twice daily in the last section of the keriyat shema. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.15.39"" data-ref=""Numbers 15:39"">Numbers 15,39</a>).', 'היה ערום מכל חית השדה, for the power of imagination which dangles before our mental eye all sorts of visions designed to stir our desire is more powerful within man than within any other creature This is what the sages meant when they said: (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sukkah.52"" data-ref=""Sukkah 52"">Sukkah 52</a>) “anyone who is of greater stature than his fellow also has to contend with a more powerful evil urge than his fellow.”', 'ויאמר אל האשה, her relatively weak intellect was too lazy to understand that the images dangled before her eyes were a fatah morgana, illusion. אף כי אמר אלוקים, even though G’d has said not to eat from the tree of knowledge פן תמותון, in order that you do not die, this is not true, you will not die. Once the “serpent,” i.e. her power of imagination had sown the seed of doubt in her mind, so that her intelligence had already been undermined, she said: ']"
Genesis, 3,2,"['עץ הגן נאכלת, “we can eat from the trees of the garden and do not need to endanger our lives by eating from the tree that G’d has prohibited us to eat from on pain of death.” Having said this, however, her power of imagination kept nagging at her weighing the possibility that G’d might indeed be jealous of competition from his creature. Her doubt, i.e. the voice of the evil urge, was expressed in the words ']"
Genesis, 3,4,"['לא מות תמותון “you will sure not die, כי יודע אלוקים כי בים אכלכם ממנו ונפקחו עיניכם, G’d did not forbid this fruit because it is lethal, but because He knows that through eating it you will attain additional knowledge so that you will be just like G’d, possessing total knowledge.']"
Genesis, 3,6,"['ותרא האשה כי טוב העץ למאכל, she realized that the tree was good to eat due to its location, its nature and the pleasant fragrance of its fruit.', 'ונחמד העץ להשכיל, seeing that G’d Himself had already described the tree as being the tree of knowledge.', 'גם לאישה עמה, his heart was open to her words because he was her husband, and because he was by her side.']"
Genesis, 3,7,"['ותפקחנה עיני שניהם, they compared mentally, the advantages they had gained through the pleasant sensation of eating from the fruit of the tree, and the harm they had caused themselves thereby. The expression פקח implies weighing something carefully with both heart and mind. We find an example of this expression in such a sense in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.14.3"" data-ref=""Job 14:3"">Job 14,3</a> אף על זה פקחת עינים, “Do you fix your gaze even on such a one?” [Job referring to the transient nature of man and if he is worth G’d’s attention.

Genesis, 3,8,"['מתהלך בגן, back and forth, in accordance with the requirements of their purpose. The word is similar in meaning to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.13.17"" data-ref=""Genesis 13:17"">Genesis 13,17</a> where Avraham is instructed by G’d התהלך to “crisscross the land of Canaan, in order to symbolically lay claim to it.” The same construction is also found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.105.13"" data-ref=""Psalms 105:13"">Psalms 105,13</a> ויתהלכו מגוי אל גוי, “they wandered from nation to nation.”', 'לרוח היום, according to His pleasure on that day. The word רוח is used in the abstract, spiritual sense, not referring to a breeze. This is no different that what G’d had also done during the other days of creation, and as He had been doing on this same day (sixth day of creation) prior to Adam’s sin.', 'ויתחבא, as the Torah wrote in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.23.15"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 23:15"">Deuteronomy 23,15</a> ולא יראה בך ערות דבר, “no exposure of genitals (or other shameful matters) shall be visible on you.”']"
Genesis, 3,9,['<b>Where are you.</b> Why do you not show yourselves openly as before?']
Genesis, 3,10,"['ואירא, this feeling of fear is similar to that experienced by the Jewish people in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.30"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:30"">Exodus 34,30</a> when, because of the sin of the golden calf, the people were afraid to face him after his face radiated light when he returned from Mount Sinai. ']"
Genesis, 3,11,"['מי הגיד לך, who revealed to you the difference between good and evil?', 'כי עירום אתה, that on account of familiarity with evil you felt the need to cover your genitals.']"
Genesis, 3,12,"['היא, she, who was meant to be an assistant to me has turned out to be the opposite.', 'נתנה לי מן העץ, and has become a hindrance instead of a help. By saying these words, Adam tried to blame his Creator for having committed a sin. Adam, instead of being defensive by repenting, apologizing, admitting his guilt, as did David when the prophet Natan had called him to order over his conduct with Bat Sheva, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.12.13"" data-ref=""II Samuel 12:13"">Samuel II 12,13</a>) ']"

Genesis, 3,14,"['ארור אתה מכל.

Ed.] G’d’s curse is explained in detail by the words על גחונך תלך, “you will have to crawl on your belly.” This means that the serpent will find its sustenance only laboriously, experiencing frustration in doing so. Our sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.58"" data-ref=""Berakhot 58"">Berachot 58</a>) mention how many laborious stages the kernel of wheat had to undergo until Adam finally was able to eat the bread that he made out of it.', 'ועפר תאכל, you will not enjoy the food (or other earthly pleasures) previously enjoyable. The <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.49"" data-ref=""Sotah 49"">Talmud Sotah 49</a> describes something similar happening to the Jewish people as a whole after the destruction of the Temple, saying: הטהרה נטלה את הטעם ואת הריח, והמעשרות נטלו את שומן הדגן, [the subject being the negative fallout for the entire nation of the destruction of the Temple, Ed.] “previously pleasant tasting and fragrant foods no longer tasted as well with the exception of food which needed to be consumed in a state of ritual purity, and the tithes now assumed the richness of cereals.”']"

Ed.]', 'ובין זרעך ובין זרעה, not only between Adam and Chavah, but also between their respective male and female offspring.', 'הוא ישופך ראש, these thoughts crossing man’s mind will reduce the satisfaction he obtains already in the early stages of sexual intercourse, a feeling gradually reinforced when he considers the potential harm he may cause himself by indulging in copulation, diminishing both the qualitative and quantitative enjoyment of it.', 'ואתה תשופנו עקב, he who initially derives pleasure from his superiority will eventually cause himself harm at the end of the pleasure cycle.']"

Genesis, 4,2,"['ויהי הבל רועה צאן, Hevel chose this vocation as it required more intelligence and involved one’s mental activities more that farming.', 'וקין היה עובד אדמה, as a result of each having his own vocation, they each brought different offerings to G’d.']"

Genesis, 4,9,"['אי הבל אחיך, “in which place did you bury him?” G’d phrased this as a question only in order to give Kayin a chance to begin the process of repentance, not because He was not perfectly aware where Kayin had buried Hevel. G’d did not want to be forced to kill someone already guilty of the death penalty.', 'לא ידעתי, “I do not know.” He thought that the question concerned Hevel’s whereabouts. Seeing that Kayin had not been interested previously in G’d’s ability to know the future, or to become close to Him; such knowledge about G’d was reserved to those who are cleaving to Him.']"
Genesis, 4,11,"['ארור אתה מן האדמה, cursed and deprived of the good the earth has to offer.', 'אשר פצתה את פיה, because it allowed itself to be used to cover up the killing of your brother. As a result, earth will no longer be free to provide the needs of your livelihood in the degree it did up until now. There was no need to spell out the penalty for the murderer. His punishment is part of the principle applying to the penalty for anyone causing willful damage, i.e. he will experience tit for tat as spelled out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.24.19"" data-ref=""Leviticus 24:19"">Leviticus 24,19</a>.']"
Genesis, 4,13,"['גדול עוני מנשוא, after Kayin finally realised how G’d in Heaven supervises every detail which goes on down on earth, he was convinced that G’d must know that his sole motivation in doing repentance was to escape punishment. Even this type of repentance was wrung from him only after G’d had pressured him to display penitence. He was embittered, and this is what prompted him to exclaim that the severity of his sin was such there was no hope to obtain forgiveness which would protect him against retribution in kind. The matter is similar to Saul’s failure in killing Agag, King of Amalek. Saul had said to Samuel: “I have sinned,” only after Samuel had insisted that he make a confession of having failed to carry out G’d’s instructions.

Genesis, 4,15,"['כל הורג קין שבעתים יוקם, I, G’d, announce that anyone who dares to kill Kayin, [i.e. who takes the law into his own hands, Ed.] would be punished seven more times than what the crime he committed appears to warrant. Anyone who is prepared to kill someone is called הורג, as for instance, in Hoseah 9,13 ואפרים להוציא אל הורג בניו, “Ephrayim too must bring out his children to his slayers.” The word שבעתים means “twice seven times,” as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.6.31"" data-ref=""Proverbs 6:31"">Proverbs 6,31</a> ונמצא ישלם שבעתים, “when he is found out he must pay twice sevenfold.” G’d decreed therefore that when someone killed half the human race, or at least a third of the human race, the appropriate vengeance would involve a twice sevenfold penalty. This would manifest itself in such a slayer being a restless wanderer on earth for seven generations. Such a life is considered worse than death. When David prays in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.59"" data-ref=""Psalms 59"">Psalms 59</a>,12אל תהרגם פן ישכחו עמי הניעמו בחילך, “do not kill them lest my people will forget them; make them wanderers seeing it is in Your power,” he meant that they be killed only at the end of seven generations. David wanted the punishment of his enemies to last. If they would all die and disappear at once their absence would soon be forgotten. Kayin got his deserts at the end of seven generations as we know from traditional sources in Tanchuma 10.']"

Genesis, 6,12,"['והנה נשחתה, without external influences, as a natural consequence, not due to man’s ecologically criminal behaviour.

Genesis, 6,13,"['<b>The end of all flesh.</b> That is, the end of their 120 year reprieve.

Thus all the earth’s bounty went to thieves.', 'והנני משחיתם את הארץ, so that now I will destroy them together with the earth. I will destroy the climate which could support life on earth by interfering with the sun’s orbit and rearranging it from the beginning of the deluge for the entire future. We find that G’d explained this to Job In Job 38, 4-15. This accounts for the lifespan of man having been drastically reduced after the deluge. The climate of the earth changed, there were greater extremes of heat and cold, the produce of the earth was considerably less capable of supporting a long lifespan. As a by-product of this deterioration in the quality of the vegetable products, man was allowed to eat meat as a compensation.']"

Genesis, 7,24,"['ויגברו...חמישים ומאת יום. These 150 days are counted from the beginning of the 40 days of rainfall. The level of water on the surface of the earth kept increasing for 150 days, concluding on the 17th of the seventh month (Nissan). On that date the ark came to rest (on the waters) seeing there was no pressure exerted on it from any direction. The pressure on the ark to move was exerted from the first day of the rain when the Torah simultaneously reported the fountains below opening and adding their water to that of the rain. (verse 11). The ark resisted this pressure until the waters on earth were so high that they lifted the ark from its base. When the days of rainfall had concluded, the pressure from the subterranean waters kept up until the end of 150 days. When that pressure ceased the ark finally came to rest on Mount Ararat.']"
Genesis, 8,7,"['וישלח את העורב, to find out if the atmosphere had dried out after the tops of the mountains had become visible.

This enabled the appetites to achieve domination']"
Genesis, 8,22,"['עוד כל ימי הארץ זרע וקציר, וקור וחום, וקיץ וחורף, ויום ולילה, לא ישבתו; nature will not cease to function dependably as it had prior to the deluge. The sun will orbit predictably, its orbit will be subject to calculation in advance, so will be its position relative to other phenomena in the sky. All the time periods mentioned in this verse will somehow be related to the position of the sun at different times during the year. It would be different from before the deluge. Whereas prior to the deluge the sun had remained at a fixed distance relative to the earth all year round, its orbit being circular, resulting in eternal spring in the populated parts of the earth, now there would be all these changes, though at predetermined intervals, resulting in alternating seasons of relative warmth and cold due to the elliptical nature of the sun’s orbit [Although the author lived approximately at the time of Copernicus having determined that the earth moves around the sun instead of being the center of our galaxy, the basic concept even according to the ancient world view does not invalidate the author’s description of antediluvian and postdiluvian climatic conditions. Ed.. כל ימי הארץ, until such time as G’d would correct this deterioration in living conditions on earth due to the effect of the deluge. This “correction” is what the prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.22"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:22"">Isaiah 66,22</a> had in mind when he spoke of the הארץ החדשה אשר אני עושה, “the new earth which I am going to make.” In that future foreseen by the prophet, the sun will once more orbit like a circle instead of like an ellipsis, a configuration responsible for the uneven temperatures on earth during different parts of the year. At that time, the whole vegetation on earth will undergo an upgrading, the curse earth experienced both after Adam’s sin and after Kayin’s murder of his brother Hevel being lifted. Conditions of length of human life will revert to what they had been before the deluge, as the prophet said that a נער, a youth, if he dies at a hundred years old will be considered as having died in his adolescence and more verses there describing this future. This is also what David referred to in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.65.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 65:9"">Psalms 65,9</a> מוצאי בוקר וערב תרנין, “You make the lands of sunrise and sunset shout for joy.”']"
Genesis, 9,4,"['אך בשר בנפשו, but the flesh of living animals, while its life-force is still inside it,', ' i.e. this life-force is equivalent to its blood; you must neither eat its flesh nor its blood,', 'לא תאכלו, only in that state must you not eat it; once the blood has left the body, gentiles are allowed to eat blood.']"
Genesis, 9,5,"['ואך את דמכם לנפשותיכם אדרוש, although I will not punish you for spilling animal’s blood, I will hold you responsible for shedding the blood of fellow human beings. Human beings, all human beings, are more precious to Me than the lives of animals. This retribution for spilling the blood of human beings may on different occasions be applied in different ways: It all depends on the worthiness of the person under attack or potential attack. If, for instance, the person deserves saving, the words מיד כל חיה אדרשנו ומיד אדם are meant in the preventive sense, i.e. G’d will save such a person’s life be it under attack from animals or from human beings. If, in the eyes of G’d, the person under attack does not deserve being saved from violent death, this still did not give the animals or other human beings the right to kill him. Therefore, in such instances, ipso facto, G’d will exact retribution from the killers. ', 'This is the meaning of the apparently redundant words מיד איש אחיו אדרוש את נפש האדם, where the word אדרוש refers to the life of a human being that has already been killed. We find the word אדרוש in both senses depending on circumstances, compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.34.10"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 34:10"">Ezekiel 34,10</a>. The emphasis on איש את אחיו, refers to G’d exacting such retribution from humans for killing humans, seeing that this is not their nature, or should not be their nature. He will not exact retribution from an animal which killed a human being who, in G’d’s eyes, had already forfeited its right to live.']"
Genesis, 9,6,"['באדם דמו ישפך, a reference to a human tribunal.', 'כי בצלם אלוקים, this is the reason why G’d exacts retribution for killing human beings, whereas He does not exact retribution from man for killing animals, [even though killing, say for sport is prohibited. Ed.] The animals have not been created in the image of G’d, so that their death does not deprive the earth of a divine image. Only human beings are described in the Torah, on occasion, also as אלוהים, as for instance in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.22.8"" data-ref=""Exodus 22:8"">Exodus 22,8</a>. <br> את האדם, from the moment G’d had said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.26"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:26"">Genesis 1,26</a>) נעשה אדם, “let us make a human being,” He had endowed His creatures with an independent intelligence, able to defy Him either collectively or individually. It is this “divine attribute” of man that makes him sufficiently important for his Creator to demand an accounting from those who destroy that divine image by killing a human being.']"
Genesis, 9,7,"['ואתם פרו ורבו, not only must you not diminish the human population on earth, but you are commanded to increase it by being fruitful and by multiplying.']"
Genesis, 9,9,"['ואני הנני מקים את בריתי, this promise is conditional on man keeping his part of the bargain, bringing murderers to justice. If, however, innocent blood will be shed in the manner it had been before the deluge, this may lead to destruction of the earth (not necessarily by water). This is what is meant in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.35.33"" data-ref=""Numbers 35:33"">Numbers 35,33</a> הדם הוא יחניף את הארץ ולארץ לא יכופר לדם אשר שפך בה כי אם בדם שפכו “for blood turns the earth into a hypocrite and there will be no atonement for the land except through the blood of him who has spilled it.” ']"

Genesis, 9,13,"['את קשתי נתתי בענן, I have arranged that the rainbow become a natural phenomenon.', ""והיתה לאות ברית, there is a dual function to the rainbow; it is true that the scientists have already tired of trying to explain the phenomenon of the various colours of the second rainbow, something which appears in the opposite order of the colours in the original rainbow, [according to the encyclopedia Britannica, there are primary and secondary rainbows, the secondary rainbow having a colour pattern in a reverse order of that known as the primary rainbow. Our author may understand that which has baffled scientists in his time, as a hint of the dual nature of the rainbow, i.e. as a warning, or a promise respectively. Ed.] According to the view of the sages in Ketuvot 77 the very appearance of the rainbow is a reminder that the generation in which it appears is a guilty generation. It is reported there that two generations were fortunate enough that in their time no rainbow was ever observed. This was interpreted as a sign that the people of that generation did not need the phenomenon of the rainbow to alert them to become penitents. Their religious leaders did an outstanding job in prevailing on the people to be Torah-observant. [according to the של'ה, it is not reasonable to assume that there were periods when the laws of nature were suspended and there was no rainbow; rather if the Jewish people during certain periods were very deserving, had lots of merits, so that they did not need to be reminded of the deluge, the rain descended at night when no rainbow would become visible even if they had not been a deserving generation.

Genesis, 9,17,"['ויאמר אלוקים לנח זאת אות הברית, the word זאת refers to the “secondary” rainbow, [I mentioned earlier. Ed.] which acts as the sign of the warning aspect of the covenant. When this rainbow appears it is high time to call people to order and to warn them of impending natural calamities unless they change their ways.']"
Genesis, 9,18,"['<b>Cham was the father of Canaan.</b> Canaan infamous for his wickedness and Cham was similar in character, thus he was the father of Canaan in the spiritual as well as the biological sense.']"

Genesis, 9,20,"['<b>Noach began.</b> Since his first undertaking was an unworthy one it led to disgraceful consequences, illustrating that a small flaw at the outset of an endeavor leads to a large one in the end.']"
Genesis, 9,22,"['וירא חם אבי כנען את ערות אביו, he saw the shameful deed his son כנען had done to his father Noach when he had castrated him.

Genesis, 11,5,"['וירד ה\' לראות, The Torah uses the expression “G’d descended to see, etc.,” only when the sins committed by the people concerned were not yet ripe for severe punishment but would become so if left unchecked. Retribution which results from G’d “descending,” must be viewed as a kind of preventive medicine, designed to avoid the need for more drastic action at a later stage. One well known example of G’d’s preventive retribution is the בן סורר ומורה, a thirteen year old who stole a little meat and wine from his parents, and whose punishment is execution if the parents brought him to court as an unmanageable teenager (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.21.18"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 21:18"">Deut. 21,18</a>, see Rashi, and <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.72"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 72"">Sanhedrin 72</a> on this). In the case of Sodom, where G’d is also reported as “descending,” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.18.21"" data-ref=""Genesis 18:21"">Genesis 18,21</a>) this also occurred at a time when their sin had not yet been greater than that of other surrounding nations, so that only these cities had to be singled out for punishment at that time. What distinguished the Sodomites was only the cruelty with which they committed the same kind of sins as those committed by other nations. This would eventually have led to such a corrupt world that the need for G’d to intervene on a global rather than a local basis, would have become unavoidable. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.16.49"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 16:49"">Ezekiel 16,49</a> also describes the sin of the Sodomites in such terms when he wrote הנה זה היה עון סדום אחותך...ויד עני ואביון לא החזיקה”This was the sin of Sodom your sister…..but the hand of the poor and the needy she did not support.” Similarly, the punishment of the Israelites when they were exiled was brought forward out of concern that something worse might become their fate if G’d did not intervene at that time and exile them so that He would not eventually have to punish them even more harshly.

Genesis, 11,6,"['הן עם אחד, the only way I can stop them from carrying out their unanimously approved plan is to sow the seeds of discord between them. The instrument of bringing this about is to confuse their language. Basically, people’s disagreements are either religious, (philosophical) in nature, or they result from misunderstanding what they mean when they speak. These people had been of one mind in matters of religion, seeing that they had all agreed with the mistaken idolatrous philosophy shared by mankind at that time. In spite of such apparently good reasons for disagreeing with one another, they did not misunderstand each other.', 'וזה החלו לעשות, and yet they all agree to begin this project. ', 'ועתה לא יבצר מהם, in view of these circumstances, if left alone, they would complete what they have set out to do, so that this form of idolatry they have agreed on would henceforth be something embraced by all of mankind. Not a single one of them would turn to the Creator of the universe and realise that He, and He alone, is the Creator of the entire universe. On the other hand, the opposite will occur if discord will break out among them regarding the supremacy of any of the deities versus the competing ones. In such a scenario, every nation would believe that there is one deity that is superior to all the various national deities, whose concern is only with the particular nation worshipping that deity. All the minor deities would have to subordinate themselves to the power of that super-deity. The prophet Maleachi 1,11 expresses this in the following words: ”for from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honoured among the nations;” כי ממזרח שמש ועד מבואו גדול שמי בגוים. ']"
Genesis, 11,11,"['ויולד בנים ובנות, the Torah does not mention even once the word וימות, “he died,” something that appears with the report of each of the generations preceding the deluge. The reason why the Torah mentioned the death of those generations was because each of them died before the main subject of the entire chapter had been reached, i.e. the destruction of life on earth by the deluge. The people in the generations from Noach onward are considered as having been forerunners fo a positive development, as opposed to their predecessors who simply died before everybody else died also. In our chapter the thrust of the story is to show that eventually a towering personality such as Avraham emerged on earth, so that those who preceded him may be viewed as paving the way for Avraham’s eventual emergence on the stage of history. Avraham’s greatness is enhanced by the relatively insignificant lives of his predecessors.']"

Lot, on the other hand, did the opposite for a while at least, having joined Avraham, kept him company and this is why both he and his offspring benefited from this both immediately, such as when Lot became rich in Egypt, as well as much later when Israel was not allowed to conquer the lands belonging to Lot’s descendants, i.e. Ammon and Moav.

Genesis, 12,1,"['אל הארץ אשר אראך, to the specific area within the country which I will show you in a heavenly vision. This is why Avram kept moving further into the land without pitching his tent to settle down until he received the appropriate sign from G’d. This occurred when he reached Shechem, where we are told that G’d appeared to him (verse 7)']"
Genesis, 12,2,"['והיה ברכה, a true blessing by G’d is when G’d rejoices in our deeds and actions. Our sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.7"" data-ref=""Berakhot 7"">Berachot 7</a>) illustrate this when they quote a conversation between the High Priest Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha who, while offering incense on Yom Kippur, had a vision of the angel Katriel sitting on the throne of G’d. The latter said to him: “Yishmael, My son, bless Me.” He said to him: (in the words attributed as being G’d’s own ‘prayer’) “may it be Your will that Your mercy will subdue Your anger and may Your mercy exile Your justified attribute to punish Your people for their sins, and may Your mercy prevail so that You deal with Your children by applying the attribute of Mercy.” When G’d’s representative, the angel Katriel heard this, he touched the High Priest on the head, which the latter took as a sign that the blessing uttered by an inferior creature for a superior should not be dismissed as worthless.” [I have stuck more closely to the text of the Talmud than did the author here. Ed.] G’d here blessed Avram, with becoming the one who would preach monotheism including awareness of the benevolence of G’d which He extends to all of His creatures.']"
Genesis, 12,5,"['ויצאו ללכת ארצה כנען, a land of which they had heard that it was singularly suited for people of their religious beliefs, a land in which the true G’d could be worshipped without hindrance.', 'ויבאו ארצה כנען, as opposed to Terach, who had also set out originally to go to the land of Canaan but had stopped at Charan, these people with Avram at their head made good on their intention.']"
Genesis, 12,6,"['ויעבר אברם בארץ, Avram did not stop anywhere in his journey south through the land of Canaan until G’d appeared to him as He had said: “to the land which I will show you.” (verse 1).']"
Genesis, 12,8,"['בית אל מים והעי מקדם, between two large cities, in order to attract large crowds who could hear him preach.']"
Genesis, 12,9,"['הלוך ונסוע הנגבה, when he journeyed, as is the custom of shepherds, he did not move to the east and to the west alternately, but kept moving in a southerly direction. He did this in order not to deviate from moving between one of the two towns he had been between when he first stopped between Bet El and Ai. Members of those cities had begun to trail him planning to join him.']"
Genesis, 12,10,"['לגור שם, not to settle there permanently.']"
Genesis, 12,11,"['כאשר הקריב, close to the time when it became necessary to take such precautions, so that he would not forget.', 'לבא מצרימה, a country which was equivalent to a giant brothel. This is mentioned even more forcefully in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.23.20"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 23:20"">Ezekiel 23,20</a> where the prophet describes the carnal attitudes of the Egyptians as אשר בשר חמורים בשרם, וזרמת סוסים זרמתם, “those whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys, and whose sperm is the sperm of horses.” ']"
Genesis, 12,12,"['והרגו אותי, because they do not expect me to agree to give you to them.']"
Genesis, 12,13,"['למען ייטב לי, so that when you will say that you are my sister, each one will entertain the hope that I will agree to your marrying them. Therefore, none of them will have any reason to kill me. Rather, he will seek my approval by offering me a dowry for you. It was the custom in those days that the father of the bride would be bribed with money or its equivalent to agree to let his daughter marry someone. This also explains why the Torah speaks of מהר ימהרנה in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.22.15-16"" data-ref=""Exodus 22:15-16"">Exodus 22,15-16</a>, i.e. “he (the seducer) shall pay a heavy dowry,” and why the option to refuse such a marriage is not so much the girl’s but her father’s, as we see from the verse following.']"
Genesis, 12,14,"['ויראו המצרים, all of them, when looking at Sarai, entertained the very thoughts Avraham had anticipated.']"
Genesis, 12,15,"['ויראו אותה שרי פרעה, they quickly quashed any hopes the commoners had entertained relating to marrying this woman.']"
Genesis, 12,16,"['ותקח האשה ולאברם היטיב, the members of Pharaoh’s household did not even waste time to seduce Sarai but abducted her forcefully. They thought that seeing that it was a compliment for Sarai to be desired by the king himself, she would automatically consent to such an elevation of her status. Seeing that she had described herself only as Avram’s sister and not his wife, they had no reason to believe that there was a legal obstacle to such a union. Pharaoh himself said “I took her as a wife for myself,” not a concubine, not a mistress. In verse 19 he explains that he had taken Sarai as a wife, feeling certain that she was not legally linked to any other man.']"
Genesis, 12,17,"[""וינגע ה' את פרעה נגעים גדולים, only Pharaoh was struck with “great” afflictions, "", 'whereas his household suffered lesser afflictions. This was arranged by G’d so that the Egyptians, when they saw that only Sarai had remained completely immune to these afflictions, would conclude that the afflictions were on account of her and her fate.']"
Genesis, 12,18,"['למה לא הגדת לי, even if you had reason to suspect the ordinary citizens would harm you on account of her, surely you could have told me, the king, the truth, seeing that it is my task to rule with justice.']"
Genesis, 12,19,"['?למה אמרת אחותי היא, even after she had already been brought to my palace?', 'ואקח אותה לי לאשה, so that I took her to be my wife, not my concubine. I though that seeing that she is your sister you would surely approve of this union!']"
Genesis, 13,2,"['ואברם כבד מאד במקנה, this is why he had to travel slowly, even though he wanted to return quickly to the site of the altar where he wanted to continue his preaching as he had done before the famine.']"
Genesis, 13,3,"['וילך למסעיו, this is why he traveled on his routes, i.e. the routes all the shepherds took when journeying in that direction.']"
Genesis, 13,6,"['ולא נשא אותם הארץ, the grazing land available in that region was inadequate for their combined herds.']"
Genesis, 13,7,"['ויהי ריב בין רועי מקנה אברם ובין רועי מקנה לוט, there was an argument between who would succeed to drive out the other from the available grazing land they would find.', 'והכנעני והפריזי אז יושב בארץ. This is why a quarrel between two brothers who lived side by side was especially embarrassing and harmful to the image of Avram among the surrounding tribes. When those tribes would see the brothers quarrel, they would assume that neither of them was a peace-loving individual and they would reason that they had even more reason to quarrel with either one of those recent immigrants.']"
Genesis, 13,8,"['ביני ובינך, in the future. When either one of them would select for his herds a certain grazing area.', 'אל נא תהי מריבה, the result of competing aspirations to the same grazing land.', 'ובין רועי ובין רועיך, now that we dwell here.']"
Genesis, 13,9,"['הלא כל הארץ לפניך, I’ll let you choose the area which you prefer. ', 'Therefore, הפרד נא מעלי, move away from me in the direction you prefer and I will move in the opposite direction. If you select grazing land to the left, I will select grazing land to the right.']"
Genesis, 13,11,"['ויבחר לו לוט, he selected as much area as he himself with his shepherds would manage to control as their grazing land. In this section of the earth Avram and his shepherds would not be allowed to graze. ', 'ויסע לוט מקדם, he did not turn right or left which were north and south, but he moved from the east to the west to distance himself from Avram [the author translated מקדם as meaning “from the east,” though this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Jordan valley is east from the region of Bet El and Ai where Avram and Lot had been reported last in verse 3. The area of the Jordan valley was the area from which the Israelites under the leadership of Joshua would enter the land of Canaan (Joshua chapter 4)']"
Genesis, 13,12,"['אברם ישב בארץ כנען, even though the city of Sodom and its satellite towns are on the border of the land of Canaan, the people living in those cities at that time, were not Canaanites. It was therefore in order for the Torah to write that Avram- as opposed to Lot- settled in the land of Canaan. He settled in the part of the land inhabited by Canaanites. They were not as evil as the Sodomites. Avram did not move close to the boundary of Sodom at all.']"
Genesis, 13,14,"['אחרי הפרד לוט, G’d did not say what follows while Lot was still in Avram’s company, so that the latter would not boast and his shepherds would engage in stealing grazing land from the local inhabitants claiming G’d’s promise to Avram of future possession as their justification.']"
Genesis, 13,17,"['לך אתננה, for even in your own lifetime you will be regarded as a prince of G’d, and deserving of great honour (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.23.6"" data-ref=""Genesis 23:6"">Genesis 23,6</a>)']"
Genesis, 13,18,"['ויאהל אברם, an expression denoting the encamping, erecting one’s many tents.']"
Genesis, 14,1,"['ויהי בימי אמרפל מלך שנער, who was widely known as a powerful king in his generation and also later. During his lifetime the kings listed forthwith, i.e. Aryoch, king of Elassar, Kedorlaomer, king of Eylam, and Tidal, king of Goyim, jointly made war against Bera, etc.']"
Genesis, 14,3,"['כל אלה, all the ones just named, Amrafel and the two groups that conducted the war.', 'חברו אל עמק השדים, gathered in that valley and arrived at a compromise concerning the dispute between them. From that time on, the five kings and their subjects served Kedorlaomer, paying him taxes for 12 years, after which they rebelled.']"
Genesis, 14,4,"['עבדו את כדרלעמר, after the compromise they had reached 12 years ago. Afterwards, they rebelled.']"
Genesis, 14,5,"['והמלכים אשר אתו, the ones who had been signatories to the compromise deal 12 years previously, amongst whom had also been Amrafel.', 'ויכו את הרפאים...ואת הזוזים...ואת האימים, all of these people had been subservient to the group of 5 kings headed by the king of Sodom, and had even fought wars on behalf of their masters. By telling us all this, the Torah wanted us to know that the five kings were not just paper tigers, pushovers. By inference, it enables us to imagine the military power of the four kings who defeated the five kings afterwards. Having once appreciated all this, we can image what a tremendous feat Avram accomplished when he defeated the four kings under the leadership of Kedorleomer. He must have possessed outstanding military skills in order to have accomplished this. It also testifies to the act of selfless love he displayed for his nephew, when he endangered himself and his men to such a degree in order to free him from captivity. Most of all, it gives us a chance to marvel at the mercy G’d showed both to Lot and to Avram in this sequence of events.']"
Genesis, 14,10,"['וינוסו מלך סדום, this made it plain that Avram could not rely on them that they would help him.', 'והנשארים הרה נסו, the remaining three kings. ']"
Genesis, 14,12,"['ויקחו את לוט בן אחי אברם, they made a special effort to capture Lot because he was Avram’s nephew. They were aware of his wealth. They were expecting that Avram would pay a heavy ransom for the release of his nephew.']"
Genesis, 14,13,"['ויגד לאברם העברי, this refugee had no idea that Lot was related to Avram. He only knew that Lot’s religious beliefs were similar to those of Avram.', 'והוא שוכן באלוני ממרא, this is why Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre participated in the war with Avram, and why he insisted in verse 24 that they receive their share of the loot.']"
Genesis, 14,14,"[' וירדוף עד רן, in his pursuit to attack them suddenly.']"
Genesis, 14,15,"['ויחלק עליהם לילה, he divided his forces all around them to make them believe that they were being attacked by large forces from several fronts. We have been told about a similar situation in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.7.6"" data-ref=""II Kings 7:6"">Kings II 7,6</a> when the Aramites fled headlong after hearing noises that convinced them that they were being attacked by large forces.', 'לילה, this was also part of the subterfuge, preventing the kings from realising that they were facing insignificant numbers of opponents. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.17.1"" data-ref=""II Samuel 17:1"">Samuel II 17,1</a> this was the advice to Avshalom by Achitofel when he advised to pursue David at night.', 'ויכם, the defeat caused them to flee.', ' וירדפם, the beginning of all pursuits is putting people to flight.']"
Genesis, 14,16,"['וגם את הנשים, he liberated Lot’s wives, as well as ', 'העם, all the ordinary people of Sodom who had been taken captive. It was these whom the King of Sodom asked to be restored to him, when he “graciously” (verse 21) offered that Avram could keep the chattels.']"
Genesis, 14,18,"['הוציא לחם ויין, to all those returning from battle who were tired.', 'והוא כהן, it was appropriate therefore that he should intone blessings.']"
Genesis, 14,19,"['ויברכהו ויאמר ברוך אברם לאל עליון, first he blessed on his own behalf. Then he added that Avram was also blessed by the Supreme G’d. He said basically the same as G’d Himself had said to Avram in 12,2.', 'קונה שמים וארץ, heaven and earth are His, to do with as He pleases. They do not have a will of their own as some scientists believe. G’d alone works His will on them, using them according to His will.']"
Genesis, 14,20,"['וברוך אל עליון, this power G’d gave to Avram to enable him to overcome his enemies, is a blessing for the Lord. He is able to rejoice in the deeds of His creatures when the wicked perish, and when He makes the righteous rejoice in their success. David expressed it in these words in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.117.1-2"" data-ref=""Psalms 117:1-2"">Psalms 117,1-2</a> שבחוהו כל האומים גי גבר עלינו חסדו, “Praise the Lord all you nations. Extol Him, all you peoples; for great is His steadfast love toward us;”']"
Genesis, 14,23,"['אם מחוט ועד שרוך נעל, every time the word אם occurs in Scripture and is not followed by a verb making it a conditional statement, it is used instead of the word שלא, “so that not.” Avram’s statement here means: “I have sworn an oath not to give you even a shoelace or a length of thread as I do not own any of these things. Conversely, I will also not take (accept) anything that is (was) yours.” G’d said something similar to the Jewish people after the debacle of the spies in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.14.23"" data-ref=""Numbers 14:23"">Numbers 14,23</a>) when He said אם יראו את הארץ, which is a way of saying that they will most certainly not get to see the land (of Israel). In verse 30 in the same chapter the words אם אתם תבאו also mean “you will certainly not come.” Similarly, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.15.6"" data-ref=""I Samuel 15:6"">Samuel I 15,6</a> חי ה\' אם יומת, means “an oath to G’d that he will not be executed, etc.” Also, in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.5.16"" data-ref=""II Kings 5:16"">Kings II 5,16</a> חי ה\' אשר עמדתי לפניו אם אקח וגו\', means: “As the Lord lives whom I serve, I will not accept anything.” There are many similar examples.']"
Genesis, 14,24,"['<b>I am excluding myself.</b> Literally, “Without me” — i.e. “You can take it without asking me because I claim no part of it.”  ', '<b>Only what the lads have eaten.</b> Avraham claimed only the cost of provisioning his men, but Aneir, Eshkol and Mamrei could take their share for themselves.', 'אבל ענר אשכול וממרא הם יקחו חלקם, I will neither give them a share, nor will I accept a share on their behalf, but they will themselves take the share they are entitled to.']"
Genesis, 15,1,"['אל תירא אברם, do not worry that the four kings will avenge themselves on you.', 'שכרך, not only that, but your reward over and beyond that is so great that your merits have not decreased on account of your success in that battle. You deserve much more reward for having gone to the assistance of your brother, displaying a supreme degree of love for him and for those belonging to him. You have liberated the victims of kidnappers.', 'הרבה מאד, both in this world', ' and in the world to come. We have been taught, and recite daily in our prayers, that there are things for which one receives some dividends in this world, whereas the principal comes due in the hereafter. One of the good deeds which qualify for such reward is known as גמילות חסדים, the performing of deeds of loving kindness involving not only one’s checkbook but one’s very body (Peah, 1,1).']"
Genesis, 15,2,"['?מה תתן לי, a reference to the reward in this life.', 'ערירי, “I have no son who can take my place.” Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.22.30"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 22:30"">Jeremiah 22,30</a> כתבו את האיש הזה ערירי כי לא יצלח מזרעו איש יושב על כסא דוד, “record this man as without succession; one who shall never be found successful, for none of his offspring will be accepted to sit on the throne of David.” (the subject of this curse is כניהו son and heir of Yehoyakim) ', 'ובן משק ביתי הוא דמשק אליעזר, he is only a slave, known only in his home town. There can be no question but that similar actions performed by a slave who is in constant fear of his master’s disapproval, even if in fact the same as those performed by the master’s son, are different in quality, and in effect from one another. The same chores performed by the son are motivated by love instead of by fear.']"
Genesis, 15,3,"['בן ביתי יורש אותי, even though, in the end, You will give me biological offspring, as You have said in 12,7 לזרעך אתן את הארץ הזאת, “I will give this land to your descendants,” such children will only be minors at the time, so that my servant Eliezer will have to raise them and guide them, in effect being my heir.']"
Genesis, 15,4,"['לא יירשך זה כי אם אשר יצא ממעיך, for the son would succeed taking over Avram’s leadership role amongst large number of followers while his father was still alive. This is the true meaning of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.25.5-6"" data-ref=""Genesis 25:5-6"">Genesis 25, 5-6</a> ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק בנו.... בעודנו חי,” Avraham handed over all that was his to his son Yitzchok while he was still alive.” This is followed by the statement that Avraham sent away the sons of the concubines from the presence of his son Yitzchok.']"
Genesis, 15,6,"['<b>He believed.</b> He had utter confidence that God would fulfill His promise, even if it required a miracle. ', '<b>And this He accounted.</b> God reckoned Avraham’s trust as an act of righteousness, which proves that his subsequent inquiry, “How will I know, etc.?” could not have been an expression of doubt.']"
Genesis, 15,7,"['אשר הוצאתיך מאור כשדים לתת לך את הארץ הזאת, for you, personally, will acquire this land by an act of taking symbolic possession of it. ', 'לרשתה, so that the children (descendants) would inherit it from you under the heading of an inheritance, i.e. without any interruption in this land being owned by Israelites.']"
Genesis, 15,8,"['במה אדע, for possibly my descendants will sin and forfeit their claim to this land.']"
Genesis, 15,9,"['קחה לי עגלה, take a heifer for Me, in order to enter into a covenant concerning this assurance. Converting G’d’s promise into what is known as a “covenant,” is equivalent to G’d reinforcing His promise by an oath, something which is unconditional and irrevocable. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Rosh_Hashanah.18"" data-ref=""Rosh Hashanah 18"">Rosh Hashanah 18</a>) Moses himself confirmed this interpretation when he said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.9.5"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 9:5"">Deut 9,5</a>) “not due to your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart, but due to the wickedness of these nations does G’d dispossess them on your account; and in order to keep His promise which He had sworn to your forefathers Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov ']"
Genesis, 15,13,"['<b>Know for sure.</b> God’s main point here was that the inheritance of the Land had to wait until the sin of the Emorites was complete (v. 16).

Genesis, 15,14,"['וגם את הגוי אשר יעבדו דן אנכי, just as I judge your descendants, for the wickedness with enslavement and cruel suppression, so I will judge the nation that enslaves them.""']"

Genesis, 16,5,"['חמסי עליך, ""you should have rebuked her for her conduct vis-à-vis me, seeing that she has become your wife [and you are now her boss instead of me. Ed.] She treats me as inconsequential after she has become pregnant from you.""']"
Genesis, 16,6,"['שפחתך בידך, for she has not been given her freedom by you who are her mistress.', '\tותענה שרי, Sarai\'s objective in maltreating Hagar was to remind her of the fact that she remained her slave.

Genesis, 16,9,"['והתעני, the additional comment after telling Hagar to return to her mistress, was an allusion to the future; it would be Hagar\'s destiny, as well as that of her offspring to submit to the authority of the Jewish people. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.13.17"" data-ref=""II Kings 13:17"">Kings II 13,17</a> where the prophet Elisha instructs the king to shoot arrows [which are ostensibly not intended to hit anyone.

The words כן כן יסד המלך in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Esther.1.8"" data-ref=""Esther 1:8"">Esther 1,8</a> are also to be understood in a similar fashion. The king\'s decree to let everyone enjoy the feast according to the laws of his own religion was a cornerstone of the policy which enabled Achashverosh to rule over so many diverse cultures as existed in the 127 provinces of his empire.']"
Genesis, 16,12,"['פרא אדם. The word פרא describes a wild donkey, an animal that has not been domesticated. The angel told Hagar that the son she would bear would be genetically very similar in his character to a wild donkey. This would be due to his having part of the genes of his Egyptian mother. The prophet Ezekiel already described the Egyptians as being physically not much different from wild donkeys (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.23.20"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 23:20"">Ezekiel 23,20</a>) These characteristics would manifest themselves in the fact that he would make his home in the desert, a region not imposing restrictions on him.

Genesis, 16,13,"['ותקרא שם ה, the meaning of the words ותקרא שם ה\', is prayer. It refers to the kind of prayer in which one praises the Lord, or thanks Him.

Genesis, 16,15,"[""שם בנו אשר ילדה הגר ישמעאל, he was aptly called by that name both from Avram's point of view and from Hagar's point of view. Avraham prayed on behalf of his son Yishmael in 17,20, whereas Hagar's prayer had been heard as confirmed to her by the angel. ""]"
Genesis, 17,1,"['וירא ה, a מראה is always a vision one level lower than true prophecy. This is why G\'d said to Moses in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.6.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 6:3"">Exodus 6,3</a> ושמי ה\' לא נודעתי להם, ""but I had not revealed to them My true name Hashem.""', '\tאני א-ל שדי, ""I am the One Who is sufficient unto Himself by My very existence to carry out My special function the creation of the universe all by Myself without assistance by anyone else. [The word די expresses this self-sufficiency of the Lord/Creator. Ed.] The very opposite is true of all created phenomena other than the Creator. [the difference between G\'d and creatures is that G\'d is a ""self-starter,"" whereas all other phenomena require something to activate them even when performing the functions for which they have been created. Ed.] This all means that the recipient of a visual image, מראה, a vision, becomes aware of the existence of the Creator and His power, without him however becoming aware of underlying causes of such. The patriarchs became witnesses to G\'d performing ""invisible"" miracles, as distinct from the ""visible"" miracles performed by Moses and other prophets after him to some extent. [an ""invisible"" miracle maybe recognized as such because the time and place has been foretold to the beneficiary, as in the case where the angels told Avram that Sarah would give birth to a son within the year. ""Visible"" miracles, are for instance, water turning into blood, or all the firstborn of one nation dying at the same time [after this event having been announced.] the latter type of miracle says more about G\'d as the originator of all that occurs in the universe than does the former kind of miracle. This latter kind of insight was not revealed by G\'d before Moses, as we quoted form <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.6.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 6:3"">Exodus 6,3</a>.', '\tהתהלך, an instruction to conduct himself in this manner in all his activities.', '\tלפני, as if you were looking for guidance Me in all your undertakings and trying to emulate Me. We have adopted this concept when we inscribe our synagogues with the verse שויתי ה\' לנגדי תמיד, ""I am ever mindful of the Lord\'s presence."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.16.8"" data-ref=""Psalms 16:8"">Psalms 16,8</a>)', '\tוהיה תמים, ""acquire the maximum degree of perfection human being are capable of attaining. Be intelligent so that you can acquire more intimate knowledge of Me through recognising the way I operate in the universe. As a result you will be emulate My attributes to the degree that this is possible for humans."" The deeds of man reflect his having emulated G\'d when he tried to do so. This is what Moses had in mind when he asked G\'d: הודיעני נא את דרכיך ואדעך, ""make know to me Your ways so that by this means I will get to know You."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.13"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:13"">Exodus 33,13</a>) This is the ultimate perfection that the human species is able to achieve. This was G\'d\'s objective for man when He created him, when he added the word בצלמנו, ""in our image,"" when announcing that He was about to create man with the words נעשה אדם בצלמנו כדמותנו, ""let us make man in our image"" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.26"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:26"">Genesis 1,26</a>).']"
Genesis, 17,2,"['ואתנה בריתי ביני ובינך, it is on this basis that I will establish My covenant between Me and between you. להיות לך לאלוהים ולזרעך אחריך, so that you will teach your descendants the lesson you have absorbed about Me.']"
Genesis, 17,3,"[""ויפול אברם על פניו, this was a voluntary act demonstrating his gratitude to G'd for entering into the covenant with him.""]"
Genesis, 17,4,"['אני הנה בריתי אתך, ""I am now doing what I had told you, to make the covenant actual.""']"
Genesis, 17,5,"['והיה שמך אברהם, ""henceforth you name will be Avraham. Immediately.""', '\tכי אב המון גויים נתתיך, for the significance of this name change will commence as of this day. The word נתתיך in the past tense means that this process has already commenced. This is why לא יקרא עוד שמך אברם, your name from now on will now longer be Avram, ever. This was a different name change from when Yaakov was accorded the name ישראל. That name was an additional name which did not replace his original name Yaakov. The matter will be explained in due course.']"
Genesis, 17,7,"[""להיות לך לאלוקים ולזרעך אחריך, to accept Me as your exclusive deity, without any intermediary, just as G'd is the sold G'd of all the enduring phenomena in the world (the planets, stars, etc.) Solomon phrased it thus in Kohelet 3,14: כי כל אשר יעשה האלוקים הוא יהיה לעולם. According to our author this verse proves that anything which G'd has created without intermediary is eternal, endures, whereas when we see creatures and other phenomena disintegrate, this is proof that they were brought into existence by intermediaries of G'd, by His agents, not by Himself. Observing the terms of this covenant was concluded with G'd directly, not with an intermediary""]"
Genesis, 17,8,"['לאחוזת עולם, ""I will be your G\'d in order that you may carry out My will, and He gave them the land presently belonging to other nations in order that they keep His statutes."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.105.44-45"" data-ref=""Psalms 105:44-45"">Psalms 105, 44-45</a>) When they do this they will achieve eternal existence individually, not merely as a species.']"
Genesis, 17,9,"['ואתה את בריתי תשמר, ""just as I keep My part of the covenant, I want you to keep your part of My covenant. Unless the covenant is respected mutually it will be invalid.']"
Genesis, 17,11,"['לאות ברית, as a constant reminder to walk in His paths. The sign of the circumcision is to be like the stamp on the skin of a slave identifying him as belonging to a certain master.']"
Genesis, 17,13,"['בבשרכם; the word בשר is a euphemism for the reproductive organ of the male, as for instance in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.16.26"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 16:26"">Ezekiel 16,26</a> גדלי בשר, ""with outsized male member."" Or, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.5.2-3"" data-ref=""Leviticus 5:2-3"">Leviticus 5, 2-3</a> זב מבשר, ""an uncontrolled seminal emission from his male organ."" There are more examples of the word בשר having that same meaning. Seeing that the organ on which the covenant with G\'d is marked is the organ instrumental in ensuring a man\'s continuity beyond death through the genes of his offspring, it is appropriate that the covenant which represents the eternal intimate and reciprocal relationship of G\'d and the Jewish people should be symbolized in this manner.']"
Genesis, 17,16,"['וברכתיה, both during her pregnancy, the act of giving birth, and in the raising of the son, all of these being painless. This is the exact reverse of the curse G\'d decreed on Chavah and women in general, when He said בעצב תלדי בנים, ""you will give birth to children in pain and sorrow."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.3.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 3:16"">Genesis 3,16</a>) Sarah was promised to be spared that curse which other women are afflicted with.

Genesis, 17,17,"['?הלבן מאה שנה יולד; He meant that although it is possible for a woman to become pregnant after her prime, when this occurs it is only when she sleeps with a younger man. It has not been known to occur when her partner is also an old man.', '\tהבת תשעים שנהת לד, when she sleeps with any man whether young or old. (based on Abarbanel)']"
Genesis, 17,22,"['ויעל אלוקים מעל אברהם, this formulation is juxtaposed with that when G\'d terminated his conversation with Kayin where the latter is described as ""walking away from G\'d."" (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.4.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 4:16"">Genesis 4,16</a>)']"
Genesis, 17,23,"['בעצם היום הזה, without any delay.']"
Genesis, 18,1,"['וירא אליו ה\' באלוני ממרא, because this was where Avraham had circumcised himself at that time. His whole household had been circumcised with him at the time. This is where G’d manifested Himself as a sign that He stood by the covenant, similar to the verse at the beginning of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.29.9-11"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 29:9-11"">Deuteronomy 29,9-11</a>, commencing with the words אתם נצבים היום, and to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.23.3"" data-ref=""II Kings 23:3"">Kings II 23,3</a> ויכרות לפני ה\'.

We have a similar occurrence in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.4.24"" data-ref=""Exodus 4:24"">Exodus 4,24</a> ויפגשהו ה\', where G’d “met” with Moses without delivering an oral message. At that time G’d’s purpose was to ensure that Moses would circumcise his son, to maintain the covenant which was to be an eternal covenant with the descendants of Avraham as spelled out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.17.11-12"" data-ref=""Genesis 17:11-12"">Genesis 17,11-12</a>.

Genesis, 18,2,"['וישא עיניו, he concentrated on seeing more clearly.', 'נצבים עלי, facing him.

Genesis, 18,3,"['אל נא תעבר, he addressed the one whom he considered the senior one of the three, saying “do not merely deliver your message and leave immediately, but take some refreshment first.”']"
Genesis, 18,9,['<b>Where is Sarah.</b> Avraham already knew of Yitzchok’s impending conception (see 17:19). Thus the angels were sent specifically to inform Sarah. This was in order that her rejoicing would have a positive influence on the fetus.']

She considered the kind of rejuvenation required for her to bear a child as equivalent to reviving the dead. Such an act, in her opinion, required G’d’s personal attention, not merely that of a prophet. At the very least it would come about in answer to a prayer.']"
Genesis, 18,15,"['כי יראה, to say “I have sinned;” but she repented the lie in her heart.', '!ויאמר לא, for the angel knew that as Bileam said (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.19"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:19"">Numbers 23,19</a>) “seeing than man is not G’d, he lies and deceives,” לא איש א-ל ויכזב.

Genesis, 18,17,"['ואברהם הולך..וה\' אמר.

Genesis, 18,33,"['וילך ה, Avraham remained in a waiting posture. He had not given up hope to expect further prophetic insights until it became clear to him that G’d’s presence had departed.

Genesis, 20,13,"['התעו אותי אלוקים, on account of the various alien gods which I despise I have been forced to leave my father’s house and to travel to areas I did not know, not to places of my own choice.

Genesis, 20,16,"['הנה נתתי אלף כסף לאחיך, as dowry, as was the custom for any groom marrying the daughter or sister of a man.', 'הנה לך כסות עינים, clothing consisting of a variety of colours which women used to wear as a mark of distinction. The dowry he gave her brother was intended to show that he did not consider her a whore but someone reputable, and that he did not mean her to be his concubine but his regular wife. Also, he meant that he would not have let Sarah go so easily except for Divine intervention which forced him to let her go.', 'לכל אשר אתך, before the eyes of everybody, so that they know in your household that everything is above board.', 'ואת כל ונוכחת, and you will be perceived exonerated in every respect even in the eyes of those who would have felt tempted to interpret what happened to you in a negative light, reflecting discredit upon you.']"

Genesis, 21,5,"['ואברהם בן מאת שנה, although as an old man we could have expected Avraham to delegate the task of performing his son’s circumcision, he did so himself, ignoring the fact that he was an old man.

Genesis, 21,6,"['צחוק עשה לי אלקים, even though my son has to endure the pain of the circumcision at such as tender age, nonetheless my heart is full of joy. Therefore, everyone who hears about this event will rejoice on my behalf ignoring the aspect of the circumcision.']"
Genesis, 21,9,"['את בן הגר המצרית, she assumed that the reason Ishmael had made disparaging remarks about Yitzchok was due to his mother putting him up to it, or to the Egyptian genes of his mother coming into play here.

In the case of Ishmael, he certainly did not overhear his father make such disparaging remarks.', 'מצחק, making fun of the big party Avraham had given to mark the weaning of Yitzchok, He claimed that surely Sarah must have become pregnant from Avimelech. The reason he had not made such remarks already at the time when Yitzchok had been born, was because he had only overheard wicked gossip about this at a later stage, and now he repeated what he had heard.']"
Genesis, 21,10,"['גרש האמה הזאת ואת בנה, seeing that what the son did was at the instigation of his mother. He spread lies about Yitzchok’s legitimacy in order to establish a claim to your inheritance.', 'כי לא יירש בן האמה, seeing that he is not part of your family; the child always is considered as part of the halachically defective parent.

Avraham’s having placed Ishmael’s on Hagar’s shoulder was a clear sign that Hagar was a slave woman who was charged with carrying Ishmael (verse 14)', '', 'כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע, for your descendants will be known through Yitzchok, and Ishmael and his sons will be slaves to him. Ishmael will not be known historically for his being a son of Avraham.']"

Genesis, 21,14,"['שם על שכמה, the hose containing the water; this was in order to show that she was a slave woman. A reminder of the angel at the time having told her that she was to submit to her mistress Sarah (16,9) A righteous person of the caliber of Avraham would certainly not send away a woman and her son without provisions adequate to ensure that she can reach the next location where new provisions can be obtained.

If we accept that line in the Midrash at face value, the crisis which overtook Hagar and Ishmael was only that they ran out of water due to having lost their way in the desert. As soon as they found a source of water they had all the means to establish themselves economically, even in the midst of the desert. It was natural for Ishmael to settle in the desert as his mother had been told already while she was pregnant that here son would be a פרא אדם, someone preferring to live in the wilderness, not in civilised society.

Genesis, 21,25,"['אשר גזלו עבדי אבימלך, he criticised him precisely in his position of king, seeing that robbery had been tolerated in his country and there was no one to protest this.

Genesis, 24,63,"['ויצא יצחק לשוח, he had detoured from his regular path to the field in order to pour out his heart to G’d in prayer. He did not want to be interrupted in his devotion by passing travelers whom he would have to greet. This was in spite of the fact that he had already prayed in Beer lachay Ro-i.

This is what Rivkah referred to when she asked about the man walking “toward us?” (verse 65) This is because when Yitzchok returned from Beer lachay Ro-i to his house he was walking from the north to the south. People coming from Charan (Aram Naharaym) headed for Avraham’s house would be traveling from the east to the west. This is why after having deviated from his route which would have taken him from north to south, and walking in an easterly direction instead, Yitzchok would be walking in the direction from which the camels were approaching, from the land known also as ארץ בני קדם the land belonging to the people of the East. He had reason to believe that Rivkah would come from that direction.']"
Genesis, 24,64,"['ותפול מעל הגמל, she inclined her head while remaining on the camel in honour of Yitzchok.

Ed.] The reason why the Torah employs the term עמיו his peoples” in the plural is that there are all kinds of different spiritual levels among the righteous souls, not all attained the same level of righteousness while on earth although all of them share the experience of enjoying eternal life. (compare statements in Baba Batra 75 on that subject.)']"

Genesis, 25,24,"['והנה תומים בבטנה, before they were born, the onlookers already realised that there were twins in her womb. Therefore, when the first one emerged being completely covered with hair, this was a birth which was presumed to be more difficult than the passage of Yaakov whose skin was smooth and did not cause friction with the lining of the womb, they called the first one עשו, attributing his easy passage to his twin brother who had helped push him out of the womb of his mother. [I believe that the author understands the plural ending in עשו, as equivalent to assu, i.e. the result of a combined effort by both him and his brother.]']"
Genesis, 25,26,"['ויקרא שמו יעקב. The word means he will remain at the heel, and the tail-end. This is based on the future mode of the word יעקב. Our sages (quoted by Rashi) say that the subject in our verse is G’d Who named Esau’s brother Yaakov, the reason for the unusual formulation being that after the destruction of the Kingdom of Edom and other nations, successor of Esau, only Yaakov and his descendants will remain. Our sages base all this on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.46.28"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 46:28"">Jeremiah 46,28</a> אעשה כלה בכל הגויים...ואותך לא אעשה כלה, “I will make an end of all nations…but I will not make an end of you.”']"
Genesis, 25,27,"['איש שדה, an expert farmer.', 'יושב אהלים, the plural mode indicates that the Torah speaks of two distinctly different kinds of tents; one is the tent used by shepherds, the other the tent described as בל-יצען described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.33.20"" data-ref=""Isaiah 33:20"">Isaiah 33,20</a>, (a reference to Jerusalem or the Temple). The function of that “tent” is to help people come closer to G’d and to gain insight into His ways and as a result to become holy, inspired by His glory.']"
Genesis, 25,28,"['ויאהב יצחק את עשו, also Esau, not only Yaakov, even though he must have been aware that Esau was far less perfect than Yaakov.', 'ורבקה אוהבת את יעקב, she only loved Yaakov, recognising the wickedness of Esau.']"
Genesis, 25,30,"['על כן קרא שמו אדום. When he saw that Esau was so totally absorbed in his futile occupation, an occupation which does not represent the task of man on earth, that he could not even identify the lentils by their name but referred to them only by their colour, he called him by that name himself, i.e. אדום, in the imperative, meaning “paint yourself red by swallowing the red dish!”']"
Genesis, 25,31,"['מכרה כיום, seeing that as of now all your interests are focused on your work so that you are so tired that you cannot even recognise a dish of lentils for what it is, there is no question that you would not have the time or energy to perform the duties involved in the obligations associated with being a firstborn']"

Genesis, 25,33,"['השבעה לי, seeing that the purchase under discussion was something abstract, the oath would replace the act of physically taking possession of the object purchased and moving it.', 'וימכור את בכורתו, in accordance with the price they had mutually agreed upon. The Torah did not bother to spell out the exact sum.']"
Genesis, 25,34,"['ויעקב נתן לעשו, he had used the lentils or the dish containing them as the קנין חליפין, a token used to serve as symbol of the transfer of ownership of the object constituting the one being sold. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ruth.4.7"" data-ref=""Ruth 4:7"">Ruth 4,7</a> where a shoe is mentioned as serving as such a token.', '<b>Eisov scorned the birthright.</b> Even after the sale he did not consider the birthright to be worth the money he received for it.

Genesis, 26,1,"['אשר היה בימי אברהם, ever since that time there had not been as severe a famine in the Land Of Canaan as there was at the time the Torah speaks of here, a famine severe enough to cause the inhabitants of the land to migrate in search of food.', 'וילך יצחק אל אבימלך, in order to obtain a permit to stay in his country. This teaches us that Yitzchok possessed good manners, seeing he could have claimed this as a right under the treaty between Avraham and Avimelech.']"
Genesis, 26,2,"['אל תרד מצרימה, do not let the shortage of grass to feed your livestock be the cause of moving to Egypt. (as the sons of Yaakov claimed in 47,4 to explain why they had moved to Egypt.)', 'שכון בארץ אשר אומר אליך, make huts for the shepherds and pens your livestock in the places which I will specify for you.']"
Genesis, 26,3,"['גור בארץ הזאת, I want you to stay in this country, ', 'ואהיה עמך ואברכך and even though there is presently a shortage of grazing land, if you stay where I tell you to your livestock will prosper. ', 'ואברכך, I will bless you both in money and livestock, on condition that you remain in this country. ', 'The reason is that כי לך ולזרעך אתן את כל הארצות האל והקימותי את השבועה, the reason I tell you all this is because here I will keep My oath to Avraham your father to give him and his descendants this land. While you will reside in this land you will be treated like a prince among them. You will acquire title to this land thanks to your lengthy unbroken residence on it.']"
Genesis, 26,5,"['עקב אשר שמע אברהם בקולי, in accordance with all that I commanded him;', 'וישמור משמרתי, he also did the very things which I Myself am in the habit of doing, such as to perform deeds of loving kindness. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.25.10"" data-ref=""Psalms 25:10"">Psalms 25,10</a> כל ארחות ה\' חסד ואמת, “all the paths of the Lord are love and truth, etc.”) Also, Avraham warned the potential sinners to improve their ways, something that is of utmost importance to Me. This is what he did every time the Torah records him as קרא בשם ה\', “he proclaimed the name of the Lord.” He also observed My revealed commandments מצותי, חוקותי, ותורותי, “the seven laws I laid down for all of mankind.” As a result of all this, he did not only preach to his fellow man but he practiced what he preached. Due to his possessing this virtue he became a model human being for others to emulate. At this particular stage in Yitzchok’s life, G’d did favours to him which were the result of the merits of others, i.e. the merit of his father. This theme is repeated once more in verse 24 when the Torah attributes the promise of the increase in Yitzchok’s seed to the merit of Avraham, i.e.בעבור אברהם עבדי “for the sake of My servant Avraham.” Neither Yaakov nor Avraham had ever been told that G’d’s promises to them was on account of a third party’s merit. The reason G’d’s promises to Yitzchok had been due to other people’s merits was that at that time he had not yet emulated his father’s practice of proclaiming the name of G’d, i.e. calling his fellow man to improve their lifestyles and to abandon idolatry. Once Yitzchok had begun to do this we find that even an Avimelech is in awe of him and recognises that he is the recipient of G’d’s blessings in his own right. (compare verse 26, as well as verses 28-29. All this was due to the fact that in verse 25 he is reported as emulating his father, building an altar and proclaiming the name of the Lord. Yaakov, as opposed to his father Yitzchok, has been described as being a יושב אהלים from his earliest youth, i.e. devoting himself to promoting matters spiritual, studying as well as teaching in the academy of Shem and Ever, (primarily those of the seven Noachide commandments which regulate inter personal relations.)']"
Genesis, 26,10,"['כמעט שכב אחד העם, the person described here as אחד העם, a euphemistic expression, was the king himself, who was after all, אחד העם, in a unique position compared to the common people. He had considered himself above the law doing whatever he pleased; or he had imagined that seeing that he was the king no one would dream of refusing to sleep with him, on the contrary every woman would be pleased to have been chosen for such an experience and that Yitzchok would be highly honoured to have his sister marry the king.', 'והבאת עלינו אשם, by misrepresenting who Rivkah was, you, Yitzchok, almost made us guilty of a sin, for if the outstanding citizen of this land would have taken her, this would have caused also his subjects to be punished. This is the reason why he said: עלינו, “upon us,” instead of עליו, “upon himself.” ']"
Genesis, 26,12,"['ויזרע יצחק בארץ ההיא, in accordance with G’d’s instructions “גור בארץ הזאת” (verse 3)', 'מאה שערים. In accordance with G’d’s promise to Avraham in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.12.2"" data-ref=""Genesis 12:2"">Genesis 12,2</a> ואהיה עמך ואברכך, “I will be with you and bless you,” i.e. with material blessings', 'ויברכהו ה, with money. He sold his crops for cash. According to our sages as quoted by Rashi, the estimate of the size of Yitzchok’s crops given here is to teach us something about tithing properly. [according to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bereishit_Rabbah.64.6"" data-ref=""Bereishit Rabbah 64:6"">Bereshit Rabbah 64,6</a> the question is why Yitzchok, who must have been aware that blessing does not rest on items which have been measured or weighed, bothered to measure his crop. The answer is that one must not tithe by estimating, but by measuring. If he wanted to tithe correctly, he had to first measure the size of his crop. Ed.] G’d directed the blessing to Yitzchok on account of his concern to tithe correctly, something we also find reflected in Maleachi 3,10 “bring the full tithe into the storehouse and let there be food in My House, and thus put Me to the test-said the Lord of Hosts. I will surely open the floodgates of the sky for you and pour down blessings on you.”']"
Genesis, 26,14,"['ועבודה רבה, soil ready to be worked.', 'ויקנאו אותו פלשתים, seeing that what happened on their own fields was the exact opposite of what Yitzchok experienced. They had planted extra seed only to produce smaller crops.']"
Genesis, 26,15,"['<b>The Philistines plugged them.</b> Since the king had forbidden them to harm Yitzchok physically, they gave vent to their jealousy by plugging up the wells.']"
Genesis, 26,16,"['כי עצמת ממנו, you would be able to stage a rebellion against us using all your wealth.']"
Genesis, 26,24,"['אל תירא, that they would reduce your heritage due to their constant interference with you.', 'וברכתיך, a blessing of financial success.']"
Genesis, 26,25,"[""ויקרא בשם ה'...ויכרו שם עבדי יצחק באר—ואבימלך הלך אליו. After Yitzchok had roused himself to proclaim the name of the Lord publicly, his servants started digging a successful well without encountering opposition. Not only this, but Avimelech now came to him in order to make a treaty with him, and not to interfere with him anymore. [I wonder whether the word הלך “he walked on foot,” somewhat unusual for the mode a king travels is meant to convey to us that he humiliated himself. Ed.]""]"
Genesis, 26,28,"[""כי היה ה' עמך, we do not want to make a deal with you because we are afraid of you, but because G’d is on your side.""]"
Genesis, 26,29,"['אם תעשה עמנו רעה, “that you shall not do any evil to us.” אתה עתה, just as we did not harm you. ']"
Genesis, 26,34,"['ויהי עשו בן ארבעים שנה, at that point Yitzchok was 100 years old and he did not bother to see to it that both of his sons should be provided with suitable wives. As a result,', 'ויקח אשה, את יהודית בת בארי החתי, apparently Yitzchok did not object to his sons marrying Canaanite girls, something his father had objected to strenuously.']"
Genesis, 26,35,"['ותהיין מורת רוח, they became like a razor and a knife, shortening the lives of both Yitzchok and Rivkah. The expression מורת is the same as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.13.5"" data-ref=""Judges 13:5"">Judges 13,5</a> where the angel told the wife of Manoach that the as yet unborn Shimshon must be a Nazirite and ומןרה לא יעלה על על ראשו, no “hair-trimming tool must touch his head.” Even now Yitzchok did not realise the extent of his son Esau’s wickedness. He did not protest his behaviour with a single word. This led to his ultimate error in setting out to bestow the blessing on his son Esau. This, in turn, [i.e. Esau first having been promised a blessing and then not getting it Ed.], led to Esau getting the blessing or advice that he would live (be successful) by his sword. In spite of this blessing he still hated his brother to the extent that Yaakov had to flee for his very life to another country in order to get away from his murderous intentions.']"
Genesis, 27,1,"['ותכהינה עיניו, just as what happened to the High Priest Eli who had not protested the wrongs committed by his sons. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.3.13"" data-ref=""I Samuel 3:13"">Samuel I 3,13</a>) In that instance the expression used is ועיניו קמה ולא יכול לראות, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.4.15"" data-ref=""I Samuel 4:15"">Samuel I 4,15</a>) Neither Avraham nor Yaakov experienced such problems in their old age at the age at which Yitzchok was struck by this affliction. They were both far older than Eli who died at the age of only 98. In fact, the Torah reports Avraham’s youthfulness in 25,1 when it reports him as taking another wife. Yaakov, with all the troubles he had experienced during his life was still able to see at 147 years of age, though with difficulty, (may be was very shortsighted then) as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.48.8"" data-ref=""Genesis 48:8"">Genesis 48,8</a> he is reported as clearly seeing Joseph’s sons, though they may have resembled each other so that he could not tell apart which one was Efrayim and which one was Menashe, This was in spite of the Torah (48,10) having told us ועיני ישראל כבדו מזוקן, “Yaakov’s eyes were heavy with old age,” (problems keeping the lids open?) At any rate, he could see, though not with clarity.']"
Genesis, 27,2,"['לא ידעתי יום מותי. Although the blessing will prove more effective the closer the one dispensing is to death, as was the case in the blessings dispensed by Yaakov and Moses, seeing that their souls were already closer to heaven at the time when they dispensed the blessing, Yitzchok was not aware of when he would die so that he could to time his blessing accordingly.']"
Genesis, 27,3,"['שא נא כליך, so that you will not return with your mission unaccomplished.']"
Genesis, 27,4,['<b>Made it into a tasty dish.</b> Yitzchok knew that Eisov was not worthy of the blessing that he wished to confer upon him. For this reason he instructed him to perform an act of honor towards him to give him merit. By contrast when he blessed Yaakov (28:3) he knew that he needed no additional merit.']
Genesis, 27,12,"['ולא ברכה, if perhaps he had intended to bestow a blessing upon me also, if I deceive him, then instead of such a blessing I will receive a curse.']"
Genesis, 27,13,"['עלי קללתך, I will take your curse in your place should you become the subject of a curse. We find in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.48"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 48"">Sanhedrin 48</a>, that Solomon is reported to have accepted for himself any curse which would devolve upon him for carrying out his father’s dying wish not to let Yoav die a peaceful death and David’s curses against Yoav. In the event, Solomon or his descendants were afflicted with these curses. [I presume the author just wished to authenticate that Rivkah’s statement was not spurious, and that one can substitute oneself for the target of curses pronounced on someone else. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 27,22,"['והידים ידי עשו. There can be no question that the skins had been prepared in such a fashion that the hair on them were just like the hair on human skin, for in its natural state the hair on goatskin is considerably different from that on a human skin. What the Torah testifies to then is that Yaakov’s hands now were just as hairy as the hands of Esau. It is quite possible that not only Yitzchok’s eyesight had deteriorated to the point where it did not serve him to identify objects with any degree of certainty, but that also his sense of touch had become weakened as a source of identifying objects he touched. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.19.36-37"" data-ref=""II Samuel 19:36-37"">Samuel II 19,36-37</a> would support this where Barzilai lists a number of his faculties which suffered weakness as a result of old age.']"
Genesis, 27,23,['<b>They were hairy and he blessed him.</b> Until he felt him he suspected he was an imposter and intended to curse him and as the Sages have taught — one who wrongly suspects his colleague is required to bless him.']
Genesis, 27,27,"['וירח את ריח בגדיו, in order to expand his good mood by enjoying the fragrance. Our sages have described such an experience in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.42"" data-ref=""Berakhot 42"">Berachot 42</a> where they said: “which is something which the soul enjoys while the body does not benefit from it? It is a pleasant fragrance.”', 'ויברכהו, What happened here is similar to what is described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.3.15"" data-ref=""II Kings 3:15"">Kings II 3,15</a>, where the prophet Elisha, who had been unable to secure a prophetic vision he had craved, after listening and enjoying music played for him, was able to secure the prophetic insight for which he had been waiting. Yitzchok, who, though desirous of blessing his son Esau, had not felt in the right frame of mind to do so successfully, now was able to proceed with full confidence.', 'ראה ריח בני, “you my son, take note that this is the appropriate fragrance.”', 'כריח שדה, the field does not only provide physical nourishment, its herbs, etc., but in addition it provides enjoyment for the soul which appreciates and is nurtured by the body it inhabits inhaling the fragrance of these herbs. [Yitzchok establishes the connection between ריח and רוח, “fragrance” and “spirit,” something alluded to frequently when the Torah describes G’d’s reaction to man’s sacrifices, especially the incense. Ed.]', "" It is part of G’d’s goodness, 'אשר ברכו ה, to provide phenomena on earth which are apt to lift his spirits.""]"
Genesis, 27,28,"['', '<b>And abundance of grain.</b> Sufficient that he would be able to support others.']"
Genesis, 27,29,"['וישתחוו לך לאומים, for even the kingdoms which will not serve you directly will be in a state of dependence on you seeing that you will be the superpower.', 'הוה גביר לאחיך, seeing that Yitzchok was under the impression that he was speaking to Esau, he thought that it would be in Yaakov’s interest to endure some degree dependence upon Esau while at the same time holding on to the Land of Israel as its Abrahamitic heritage. Such a political dependence would ensure that Yaakov’s descendants would turn their attention to matters other than geo-politics, conquest, etc. The fact is, that at some time in the future the Jewish state did display expansionary tendencies, only to suffer setbacks as a result. The prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Amos.6.8"" data-ref=""Amos 6:8"">Amos 6,8</a> already warned his people against such tendencies when he quotes G’d’s loathing for power politics practiced by the Kingdom of the ten tribes under the kings of Samaria. Moreover, Yitzchok thought that if Yaakov had to be subjected to foreign domination, it would be better for it to be subjected to the rule by his brother than by other nations which would treat it more cruelly. Our sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Gittin.17"" data-ref=""Gittin 17"">Gittin 17</a>) phrased this as או בטולך או בטולך דבר עשו, “it is better to be under the protection of You (G’d), or the protection of the descendants of Esau than to have to live under the rule of the Persians.” The way Yitzchok phrased his blessing was based on his knowledge that the Land of Israel would be Yaakov’s descendants exclusively, that Esau’s descendants would not have a share in it. This is why he made no mention at all of the blessing G’d gave to Avraham, nor did he make any mention of the Land of Israel.', 'אוויך ארור, the word אורריך is in the plural mode seeing that there would be numerous nations or individuals who would curse the kings and ministers of Esau when they would not be granted their rightful aspirations. The Torah therefore warned the Jewish people not to curse the political leadership or the judiciary as such curses might backfire (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.22.27"" data-ref=""Exodus 22:27"">Exodus 22,27</a>)']"
Genesis, 27,33,"['?מי איפוא הוא, if it is indeed true that you are Esau, who was the one who served me venison? When the word איפוא appears with the letter א at the end, the word is an alternative for the two words אם כן, “if so.” When the same word (phonetically speaking) is spelled with the letter ה at the end, as for instance, in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.37.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 37:16"">Genesis 37,16</a> איפה הם רועים?, the word means the same as איה, “where?”', 'גם ברוך יהיה, the appropriate translation of the whole verse would be: “if this is so that you are indeed Esau, who is the one who brought me the venison and still achieved that he will remain blessed?!” Yitzchok had felt instinctively at the time he had bestowed the blessing that it would become fulfilled for the person whom he was blessing at the time. This confirms something told us by Rabbi Chanina in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.34"" data-ref=""Berakhot 34"">Berachot 34</a> that whenever he prayed for the recovery of a sick person he could feel while praying for him if his prayer would be effective.']"
Genesis, 27,35,"['ויקח ברכתך, the blessing that would have been appropriate as suitable and effective for you. The blessing which Yaakov had been given (mistakenly), concerned matters of importance in our material life on this earthy both while in our own land or in the Diaspora. The reason Yitzchok had phrased it thus was because the blessing G’d had given Avraham and which was to be given to one of Yitzchok’s children was not appropriate for Esau. [the latter blessing was given to Yaakov in 28,4 so that Yaakov indeed had secured both blessings. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 27,36,"['הכי קרא שמו יעקב ויעקבני, did all this happen to me because at the time Yaakov was born he was named Yaakov so that he could now trick me? He was wondering if whoever had named Yaakov had predetermined some of his future character traits.', 'הלא אצלת לי ברכה, seeing that you thought at the time you dispensed the blessing that it was I who stood before you, and you surely did not have in mind to bestow upon me the spiritual blessing, the supreme blessing, you must have reserved this blessing for my brother. You surely had not intended that I, Esau, would be the sole beneficiary of all your blessings?']"
Genesis, 27,37,"['ואת כל אחיו נתתי לו לעבדים, a reference to the sons of Ishmael, and the sons of Keturah, as well as the kings of other nations. As he had said in verse 29. יעבדוך עמים, “nations will serve you.”', 'ולך איפוא מה אעשה?, in view of this what can I do now for you? What kind of blessing is left which will be of use to you?']"
Genesis, 27,39,"['הנה משמני הארץ יהיה מושבך, I am able to bless you, assuring you that you and your descendants will reside in fruitful areas of the earth, even if they will be marginally subservient to your brother.', 'ומטל השמים מעל, ועל חאבך תחיה, you will be able to live on the blessings provided by the dew without needing rainfall or having to toil the earth; you will live by your sword in times of war. even though at the same time you may be in a state of subservience to your brother and even engage in war as a mercenary on behalf of your brother or someone else. From this it follows that if you were to complain about unreasonable harshness of your brother’s yoke, כאשר תריד, and would want to ופרקת עלו מעל צוארך, “shake off his yoke from around your neck.,” i.e. revert to a different lifestyle, such as engaging in agriculture, know that then you will never become free from subservience to your brother or to someone else.']"
Genesis, 28,3,"['<b>May the Almighty … bless you.</b> With riches.', '<b>Make you fruitful.</b> With offspring.', '<b>And multiply (or “magnify”) you.</b> May He magnify your stature']"
Genesis, 28,4,"['ויתן לך את ברכת אברהם, when He had said (12,2) “become a source of blessing!” This involves his teaching people about monotheism, the acceptance of which would result in tangible blessings for those people from G’d. This in turn would make the people regard Avraham as responsible for the blessings they receive. לך ולזרעך אתך לרשתך, if the children would also be following in the footsteps of their parents acting as spiritual instructors to the people around them, their claim to this land would be reinforced. This would become an irreversible sanctification of the name of the Lord. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.49.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 49:3"">Isaiah 49,3</a> described this as G’d saying: ישראל אשר בך אתפאר, “Israel in whom I am glorified.” This is also an example of what David had in mind when he said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.31"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:31"">Psalms 104,31</a> “G’d delights in His handiwork.”', 'ארץ מגוריך, the land of Canaan in which you dwell at the present time.']"
Genesis, 28,6,"['וירא עשו כי ברך יצחק, we see from here that in spite of Esau’s noting that his father had sent Yaakov all the way to Charan to prevent his marrying one of the Canaanite girls, as this was not in keeping with his blessing, he did not pay much attention to this, except that when he saw to what extent his father was unhappy about this כי רעות בנות כנען בעיני יצחק אביו, he thought that it was due to his wives opposing his parents’ lifestyles, etc., as documented I 26,35. In order to appease his parents he then went to Ishmael to marry Machalat. One of the reasons the Torah reports these details is to show that had Yitzchok objected to Esau’s marrying Canaanite girls in the first place his objection would have been effective. If Rivkah’s intervention was effective now when she remonstrated with her husband there is no reason to believe that it would not have been effective when Esau was about to get married.']"
Genesis, 28,10,['ויצא יעקב...וילך חרנה. He set out with the destination Charan in his mind. Before he reached this destination the following incidents occurred.']
Genesis, 28,11,"['ויפגע במקום, it happened that he came to a place he had not intended to go to at all. The meaning of the word המקום is that it was a place designed to accommodate travelers overnight. Every town had such an inn in its public square. This is also why the angels who came to Lot said (19,20) כי ברחוב נלין, “we will sleep in (the inn) in the public square. The same expression is also used in connection with the פלגש בגבעה in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.19.20"" data-ref=""Judges 19:20"">Judges 19,20</a> where we read רק ברחוב אל תלין “only do not spend the night in the public inn.”', 'מאבני המקום, which had been placed there for the travelers to eat on and to sit on.']"
Genesis, 28,12,"['והנה מלאכי אלוקים עולים ויורדים..והנה ה\' נצב עליו, this foreshadowed the future when the “angels of G’d” the superpowers who had become very powerful in our world would begin their decline and end up at the bottom of the rungs of the ladder. The Lord G’d Who stood above the ladder is the symbol of the promise that G’d will never abandon the Jewish people, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.46.28"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 46:28"">Jeremiah 46,28</a> כי אעשה כלה בכל הגויים ואותך לא אעשה כלה, “even when I utterly destroy all the gentile nations, I will not destroy you.”']"

Genesis, 28,14,"['והיה זרעך כעפר הארץ, ופרצת, after your descendants will have multiplied so that they are as the dust of the earth, numerically speaking, you will spread out.

Genesis, 28,16,"[""אכן יש ה' במקום הזה, there can be no question that this is a location from where the gift of prophetic insights is dispensed, seeing that I have been granted such an insight without even having expected it or prepared myself for it spiritually. It is a fact that the characteristics of a person undergo changes in the land of Israel just as the climate and very air in this country are different, contribute to one’s mental and spiritual progress. Our sages have phrased this (Baba Batra 158) as “the very air of the Land of Israel makes one wiser.”"", 'ואנכי לא ידעתי, if I had realised the special distinction of this site I would have prepared myself mentally for receiving these Divine insights.']"
Genesis, 28,17,"['<b>He was afraid.</b> Because of the disrespect he had inadvertently shown by sleeping there.', '<b>This is none other.</b> The place that he saw in his dream was the site designated for the Beis Hamikdosh.', '<b>The gate.</b> The ladder signified that it was from that place that prayers ascend to heaven.']"
Genesis, 28,18,"['וישם אותה מצבה, he sanctified it as an altar which he would erect on his return from Charan.

Genesis, 28,20,"['אם יהיה אלוקים עמדי, to remove from me all the pressures which I am under, pressures which prevent man from giving his attention to matters which should receive his attention, i.e. to G’d and what He expects from man. What troubled Yaakov was what our sages in Eyruvin 41 described as the three problems which are liable to unbalance someone’s mind as well as his relationship to his Creator. They are: gentiles, being involved personally in natural disasters, and excessive poverty.', 'ושמרני, from wicked gentiles who would force him to change his lifestyle;', 'ונתן לי לחם לאכול, so that I will not be forced to violate both my own integrity and that ordained for me by my Maker.']"
Genesis, 28,21,"['ושבתי בשלום, from all the problems besetting man, i.e. a reference to what the Talmud had called רוח רעה. ', ""והיה ה' לי לאלוקים, then G’d will be a judge, and He can examine to see if I did not fulfill my vow to the best of my ability. The letter ו at the beginning of the word והיה, [where we would perhaps have expected Yaakov to use an ordinary future tense such as יהיה, Ed.], may be in lieu of the word הנה, meaning that Yaakov would already from now on act on the assumption that G’d would provide him with the necessities he had asked for and therefore he was willing to be judged by the attribute of Justice, not relying on the attribute of Mercy.""]"
Genesis, 29,1,"['וישא יעקב רגליו, when a person proceeds on a journey voluntarily, at his own initiative, this is described in terms of his personality carrying, lifting his feet. When the initiative is not his, even when he does not march involuntarily, under orders against his will, his feet are described as carrying him, i.e. his personality, the rest of his body. At this point of Yaakov’s journey, he belonged to the category of traveler mentioned first. We find the other category mentioned in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.23.7"" data-ref=""Isaiah 23:7"">Isaiah 23,7</a> יובילוה רגליה, “would her feet carry her?”']"
Genesis, 29,6,"['?השלום לו, Yaakov wanted to find out something about Lavan’s circumstances and state of mind before he would come face to face with him. He did so as it is not appropriate for a guest to make such enquiries about his host after he has already been welcomed in his home.']"

Genesis, 29,9,"[' כי רועה היא, she is familiar with the finer points of successfully locating pastures for her flocks.']"
Genesis, 29,10,"['כאשר ראה יעקב את רחל, until he had met Rachel Yaakov had not been interested to get involved in the problem of rolling the rock off the top of the well. He had been afraid that if he helped the three shepherds would only be concerned with watering their own flocks without waiting around to assist any other shepherds.']"
Genesis, 29,11,['<b>And cried in a loud voice.</b> He was pained that he did not merit marrying her in his youth so that by now he would have had grown up children.']
Genesis, 29,12,"['כי אחי אביה הוא, the Torah adds this at this point to justify his kissing Rachel and her allowing herself to be kissed by him.', 'וכי בן רבקה הוא, he mentioned Rivkah to Rachel although Rachel did not know Rivkah at all. He did so because he wanted her to tell Lavan about who exactly Yaakov was.']"
Genesis, 29,13,"['את שמע יעקב, that he had succeeded in single-handedly rolling the rock off the top of the well.', 'ויספר ללבן, in order to inform Lavan that he had not come to him because he needed to look for a livelihood, but rather to that he was escaping from the wrath of his brother and that his mother had commanded him to go to Lavan and to stay there for a while.']"
Genesis, 29,14,"['אך עצמי ובשרי אתה, even though you are no doubt able to make a living without me by undertaking to look after the flocks or in some other manner, the fact remains that you are my flesh and blood and it is therefore appropriate that you should stay under my roof.', 'וישב עמו, during which time he looked after Lavan’s livestock. The expression ישב implying more than just being a tourist, a visitor in someone’s house for an extended period is found elsewhere also, as for instance in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:21"">Exodus 2,21</a> when Moses is described as ויואל משה לשבת את האיש, where it means not merely that Moses agreed to stay at the house of Yitro but that he undertook to become a shepherd for him. When Lavan, in verse 19 of this chapter asks Yaakov שבה עמדי, he did not merely offer hospitality but meant that Yaakov would continue to mind his flocks. The fact that Lavan himself refers to Yaakov working for him without wages makes it clear that during the first 30 days he was not merely sitting around, but had been more than earning his keep.']"
Genesis, 29,17,"['יפת תאר, possessed of beautiful features, as described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.44.13"" data-ref=""Isaiah 44:13"">Isaiah 44,13</a> ובמחוגה יתארהו.', 'ויפת מראה, her skin looked very healthy. Colour is something which attracts closer inspection by the sense of sight. ']"
Genesis, 29,18,"['אעבדך שבע שנים ברחל, there can be no question that a righteous man such as Yaakov would not have the audacity to marry a woman and to found a family unless he were able to support her and to provide her with the requirements specified in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.21.10"" data-ref=""Exodus 21:10"">Exodus 21,10</a> as spelled out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Yevamot.19"" data-ref=""Yevamot 19"">Yevamot 19</a>. “a man is allowed to marry several wives provided he can look after them financially.” There is therefore no reason to believe that Lavan, who was himself a man of means, would give his daughters to sons-in-law who were unable to provide for them in the manner they had been accustomed to. If all this is so, how do we explain Yaakov’s referring to the time when he crossed the river Yabbok on his way to his uncle as having only his walking staff? (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.32.10"" data-ref=""Genesis 32:10"">Genesis 32,10</a>)? What Yaakov meant when he said this was that at the time he referred to he had not owned any livestock, nor any profession with which to earn his livelihood. The reason he offered to work for Lavan for 7 years was to use his work in lieu of a cash dowry he would pay her father for her hand in marriage, something that was customary in those days. Lavan’s daughters themselves referred to their father having sold them into marriage in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.31.15"" data-ref=""Genesis 31:15"">Genesis 31,15</a>. They were modest enough to know that Lavan had taken advantage of Yaakov by demanding an exorbitantly huge amount as dowry from him. We know also from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.22.16"" data-ref=""Exodus 22:16"">Exodus 22,16</a> that a father used his daughter as a source of augmenting his income and when the value of such “merchandise” had been reduced through rape or seduction of the daughter (loss of virginity) he is entitled to financial compensation by the man who seduced his daughter (when he refuses to give her to the seducer in marriage in exchange for a regular dowry).', 'בתך הקטנה, although she was very young at this time, within the seven years of Yaakov’s service for her she would mature and be able to be a wife for him in the full meaning of the word.']"
Genesis, 29,20,"['ויהיו בעיניו כימים אחדים, he considered himself as having struck a good bargain, considering Rachel as worth far more than seven years of his labour.', 'באהבתו אותה, on account of how much he loved her.']"
Genesis, 29,21,"['ואבאה אליה, let us make the consummation of the wedding immediately after the betrothal, i.e. the chuppah. He wanted to skip as many of the formalities in order to achieve his purpose of building a family with her.']"
Genesis, 29,26,"['<b>It is not done in our place.</b> Lavan claimed that the people would not allow him to keep his word, since it was in violation of local custom.']"
Genesis, 29,27,"['ונתנה לך, then they will agree for the younger one to be given to you also.']"
Genesis, 29,30,"['ויאהב גם את רחל, not only because she was his wife, and such love is natural, but because she was Rachel, because of her distinct personality and her deeds which reflected this personality.', 'מלאה, even though since she was his first wife it would have been natural for her to capture most of her husband’s love, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Yevamot.63"" data-ref=""Yevamot 63"">Yevamot 63</a>) Yaakov preferred Rachel.']"
Genesis, 29,31,"['כי שנואה לאה, because after his first meeting with her Yaakov recognised that Leah bore the symptoms of a woman who is unable to have children.', 'ויפתח את רחמה, Yaakov had thought that the reason Leah had been willing to deceive him was because of her awareness of her barrenness. She remained in such a state until G’d took pity on her and opened her womb.']"
Genesis, 29,32,"['בעניי, that my husband suspected me of agreeing to deceive him. As compensation for having been unfairly suspected G’d granted me male seed.

Genesis, 29,33,"['כי שנואה אנכי, and because of this hatred He has given me also this son.']"

Genesis, 29,35,"['על כן קראה שמו יהודה, to reflect the letters in the name which alludes to the Essence of G’d, the tetragram. Upon closer inspection we can detect elements of such allusions to G’d’s “great” name in the names of the sons Leah had born earlier also. The names mentioned both here and later in the Scriptures were not necessarily innovations, but people who had lived in former times had already been given such names. We encounter יהודית בת בארי in 26,34; there is a שמואל בן עמיהוד in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.34.20"" data-ref=""Numbers 34:20"">Numbers 34,20</a>, (so that Channah, wife of Elkanah had not invented a new name when making her son the prophet Samuel as she did.

Genesis, 30,2,"['ויחר, because she had said: הבה לי!. This sounded as if Rachel’s having children was something within the power of her husband. His anger was on behalf of his Creator, G’d, Who had been insulted by Rachel’s words. He had to ignore his love and commiseration for Rachel’s plight seeing she had been guilty of such a fauz pas.', 'אשר מנע ממך, Yaakov had detected clear physiological symptoms indicating that Rachel was incapable of conceiving.']"
Genesis, 30,3,"['בוא אליה, this was Rachel’s answer to her husband’s accusation. She had not meant that it was within Yaakov’s power to make her pregnant, but she wanted to nurse a child by the next best method, that of becoming foster mother to her handmaid’s child.', 'ואבנה גם אנכי ממנה, so that I will have a share in posterity just as has my sister through her children. ', 'ממנה, a recipe found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Megillah.13"" data-ref=""Megillah 13"">Megillah 13</a> for barren women to be jealous of other women who have no problem conceiving in order for their own organs to respond in a manner that helps them conceive.']"
Genesis, 30,6,"['דנני אלוקים, G’d was just and fair in not granting me children.', 'וגם שמע בקולי, but even so He did accept my prayer.', 'ויתן לי בן, someone who will look after me in my old age., seeing he has been born on my knees, i.e. will be raised by me. When Yaakov’s senior wives, Rachel and Leah made such statements, they thereby signaled their agreement to freeing their handmaids who had possessed slave status up until then. They did this by referring to the sons of the handmaids as בנים, children, rather than as עבדים, slaves. If their mothers had been slaves, the children would have to be viewed and treated as slaves. We have proof of this from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.21.4"" data-ref=""Exodus 21:4"">Exodus 21,4</a> האשה וילדיה תהיה לאדוניה, “the woman and her children will belong to her master.” This is the reason why these matriarchs did no longer have the mothers of the handmaids’ sons perform menial tasks for them as they did before these women were given to Yaakov to have children with. This was quite different from when Avraham had said to Sarah that Hagar, mother of Ishmael was “in your hand, do to her what you like,” i.e. she continued in her status as slave. They are always listed as בני יעקב, and participate fully in the inheritance, as opposed to a slave who cannot inherit as anything given to him automatically belongs to his master. In the case of Ishmael, the Torah had made sure by saying כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע “for your (Avraham’s) seed will be perpetuated through Yitzchok, that we would understand that Ishmael was not Avraham’s heir. (21,12)']"
Genesis, 30,8,"['נפתלי אלוהים נפתלתי, the word נפתולי is a variant of the word פתיל as in צמיד פתיל, a tightly fitted lid (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.19.15"" data-ref=""Numbers 19:15"">Numbers 19,15</a>) Rachel meant that her cleaving to her husband was an attachment containing spiritual, religious dimensions, making the bond between them immeasurably stronger.', 'עם אחותי, I did this jointly with my sister, both of us having liberated our respective handmaids in order to enable them to become mothers of the founding fathers of the Jewish people. This is what they meant when considering the sons of these former handmaids as בנים instead of as עבדים. Accordingly, Leah had already liberated her handmaid Zilpah before Bilhah had given birth to Naftali. How else could 8 of the 12 tribes have been born within 7 years of Yaakov’s getting married? 6 of these sons were Leah’s and 2 were Zilpah’s. Assuming each pregnancy lasted 9 months, and further assuming that none of these pregnancies occurred simultaneously, 8 times 9 months amounts to 72 months, i.e. 6 years. Unless Leah had given her handmaid to Yaakov before Naftali was born there would not have been enough time for Joseph to have been born at the end of the second 7 years of Yaakov’s service. At that time, after Joseph’s birth, Yaakov requested permission to go home to his parents.(3,26). The only alternative to our calculation would be that all the children were born after only 7 months pregnancy, and that none of the mothers observed even basic days of ritual impurity before again sleeping with their husbands. ', 'גם יכולתי, I have achieved what I had planned by giving my maidservant to Yaakov.']"
Genesis, 30,11,"['בא גד, this one came coincidentally, for I had not planned to ring him into the world, seeing that I had stopped giving birth. The reason why the word is spelled as a single word with the letter א missing, is to indicate that the conception and pregnancy was not planned but occurred gratuitously. Her pregnancy had somehow become terminated after it had begun. We find a similar construction of the word בגד in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.6.15"" data-ref=""Job 6:15"">Job 6,15</a>: אחי בגדו כמו נחל, “my comrades are fickle like a wadi.”']"
Genesis, 30,13,"['באשרי, this son is part of my bliss, my happiness, because he is also a son for me.']"
Genesis, 30,14,"['וילך ראובן, when he saw that his mother was unhappy that she was no longer having children,', 'וימצא דודאים, a pleasant smelling herb, the fragrance stimulating the human organs related to conceiving and giving birth. Our sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bava_Kamma.82"" data-ref=""Bava Kamma 82"">Baba Kamma 82</a>) said garlic has a similar effect on people and that this is the reason why one eats garlic on Friday nights when the husbands cohabit with their wives. The Dudaim appear to have been known as producing a similar effect. It is possible that the Dudaim had an even better effect in stimulating the feelings of love between a man and his wife. This idea is based on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Song_of_Songs.7.13-14"" data-ref=""Song of Songs 7:13-14"">Song of Songs 7,13-14</a> שם אתן את דודי לך, הדודאים נתנו ריח, “there I will give my love to you, the mandrakes yield their fragrance.” Our verse would testify both to Reuven’s righteousness and his intelligence. especially considering that at that time he could hardly have been older than 4 or five years old.']"

In order that the effect of your sleeping with him will become effective before I can use the effect of the mandrakes. You will therefore not suffer any damage if you give me some of the mandrakes now.

Genesis, 30,17,"['וישמע אלוקים אל לאה, because she had used both natural means, and then, failing to succeed, relied on prayer. She herself is on record as confirming this when she said נתן אלוקים שכרי אשר נתתי שפחתי לאישי, “G’d has given me my reward for having offered my handmaid to my husband.

Genesis, 30,25,"['שלחני ואלכה, even though Yaakov did not own any livestock at that time, seeing he had crossed the Yabbok with only his walking staff, he did have enough provisions and cash for himself and his extensive family. Had he not possessed these, it would have been irresponsible in the highest degree to undertake this kind of a journey relying on G’d’s miracles to sustain him. Furthermore, it is inconceivable that Lavan a wealthy and respected individual in his town, would consent to let Yaakov take his wives and children, Lavan’s own family, on a journey in which they would face death from starvation. Lavan’s objection to Yaakov’s departing at this time was based on self-interest. He pleaded with him, seeing he knew that his wealth had been due to Yaakov’s presence and he did not want to lose the source of his financial success.']"
Genesis, 30,27,"['אם נא מצאתי חן בעיניך, if you love me at all, as would be appropriate for people of the same flesh and blood. It is not proper for you to abandon me at this stage. Why would he term Yaakov’s leaving for his own home as abandoning Lavan? נחשתי, I am absolutely convinced that my good fortune during the last 14 years commenced with your arrival at my doorstep. As the Talmud <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.42"" data-ref=""Berakhot 42"">Berachot 42</a> puts it:תכף לתלמיד חכם ברכה, attaching oneself to a Torah scholar and playing host to him results in the host receiving Divine blessings. [the Talmud quotes our verse as its source. Ed.]', '<b>Ad-noy has blessed you with my coming.</b> Lavan attributed his prosperity to Yaakov’s fortune whereas Yaakov insisted it was due to his effort. But one way or another, it was true that Hashem had blessed Lavan with his coming.']"
Genesis, 30,29,"['אתה ידעת את אשר עבדתיך, do not attribute your sudden wealth to the power of your teraphim, i.e. to influences connected with your horoscope, but attribute it to the faithful manner in which I tended your flocks, and to my expertise as well as my dedication in maximising the potential connected with the craft of being an expert shepherd.', 'ואת אשר היה מקנך אתי, the herds had contained defective animals, maimed ones, etc.; I cured those using my expert knowledge in raising sheep, and cattle.']"
Genesis, 30,30,"[""ויברך ה' אותך לרגלי, still, when you said that the Lord blessed you during my presence here, this is true beyond a doubt;"", '<b>When will I also do.</b> When will I have the opportunity to bring blessing to my own house the way you have brought it to yours through my presence', 'מתי אעשה גם אנכי when will it be my turn to do something blessed by the Lord for my own household? The kind of wages paid to shepherds are not adequate to enable me to accumulate some wealth for my family as you have succeeded in doing for your family.']"
Genesis, 30,31,"['?מה אתן לך, so that you will achieve what you hope to achieve? ', 'לא תתן לי מאומה, if the Lord will see fit to bless me, He will certainly not deny you what you are entitled to. Our sages have a rule that a person cannot negatively influence what his fellow human is entitled to. (Yuma 38)']"
Genesis, 30,32,"['הסר משם כל שה, the young ones, not the adult ones; so that some of them would give birth to young ones with the same skin patterns as the younger ones and will be part of my share.']"
Genesis, 30,33,"['<b>My righteousness … when it comes before you.</b> Or, “When my righteousness shall go to show my wage, it will testify before you” — i.e., Hashem will reveal what Yaakov deserves for his faithful service by altering the coloration of the lambs.']"
Genesis, 30,34,"['לו יהי כדברך, so that you will be satisfied with the results of your own proposal. [Lavan assumed that Yaakov had shot himself in the leg with his proposal. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 30,35,"['ויסר ביום ההוא את התישים, after Lavan had agreed to Yaakov’s proposal he removed not only the females with such skin patterns as Yaakov had mentioned, etc., but also the males both young an mature ones. [His objective was to make it almost impossible for Yaakov to prosper by relying on genetic factors. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 30,38,"['לנכח הצאן, he positioned the staves before the line of vision of the sheep in order to make them look when this work was performed, and this experience would be anchored in their imagination at the time they conceived and were pregnant. Visual impressions formed during such periods are of lasting value and usually produce some effect in the young animals born as a result of that pregnancy.']"
Genesis, 30,40,"['אל עקוד וכל חום בצאן לבן, this was after Lavan had already reneged and changed the rules of the contract by allocating to Yaakov newly born lambs with different skin patterns than had been agreed to originally.']"
Genesis, 30,42,"['ובהעטיף הצאן לא ישים, in order that Lavan should not think that the results which so clearly favoured Yaakov could have been achieved only through deceitful activities on his part.']"

Genesis, 31,1,['<b>He heard the words.</b> He heard that Lavan’s sons were slandering him out of jealousy.']
Genesis, 31,2,['<b>Yaakov saw Lavan’s face.</b> He saw that he had accepted his sons’ slander.']
Genesis, 31,3,"['!ויאמר אלוקים אל יעקב שוב, The Torah informs us that as a result of the meeting between Yaakov and his wives he fled from Charan without taking formal leave of Lavan as ordinary courtesy would have required him to do. He was convinced that in view of the fact that Lavan had accepted the badmouthing of him by his sons, he would steal some or most of his belongings before allowing him to leave. He said so himself during the confrontation in verse 31 when he expressed concern that Lavan would even have robbed him of his wives, claiming them as his seeing that they were his daughters.', 'ואהיה עמך. So that you will not be harmed on the way.']"
Genesis, 31,14,['<b>Do we still have a portion.</b> Why do you think it will be difficult for us to part from our father?']
Genesis, 31,16,"['b&gt;All the wealth that Elokim rescued.

Genesis, 31,20,"['<b>Yaakov fooled Lavan.</b> He did not give any sign that he knew that Lavan had accepted the slander about him.', '<b>The Aramean.</b> Besides indicating his nationality, which is irrelevant here, this hints that he was an experienced swindler (<i>ramai</i>). Thus if he had realized that Yaakov knew of the change in his attitude he would not have left him any escape.', 'על בלי הגיד לו, the word על here is used as in על עולת התמיד in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.28.10"" data-ref=""Numbers 28:10"">Numbers 28,10</a> where it means: “with, in addition to.” Yaakov acted as if unaware of Lavan’s hatred in addition to not informing him of his intended departure. All of this was not exactly in accordance with accepted norms of conduct, but as dictated by sheer necessity, his survival instinct.<br> כי בורח הוא; out of fear that Lavan would rob him with the aid of the people of his town. He said so to Lavan later when explaining his decision and his actions.']"
Genesis, 31,21,"['ויברח, usually the word בריחה, flight, means that someone departs without being pursued. The flight is inspired by fear of damage and harm not imminent. When the word ניסה is used to describe flight, this describes people fleeing from pursuers, out of fear from immediate damage and harm.']"
Genesis, 31,24,"['<b>Guard yourself that you do not speak.</b> You are forbidden even to speak!', '<b>Either good.</b> Do not try to lure Yaakov into returning with offers of benefits. <b>Or evil.</b> And do not threaten him.']"

Genesis, 31,30,"['ועתה Now that you have left without obtaining my permission and you misled me, I assume', '<b>Now you have gone.</b> You must have run off in this manner because you so yearned for your father’s house.', '<b>But why did you steal.</b> Your yearning for your father’s house was no justification for stealing my gods.']"
Genesis, 31,31,"['פן תגזול את בנותיך, by saying that you had not given me your daughters in marriage in order for me to remove them from your homeland you would in effect commit robbery as you would detain both my children and my estate. In fact, Lavan used exactly this kind of argument when he said: “the children are my children the daughters are my daughters, etc.” (verse 43). You might have succeeded in doing all this with the help of the local townspeople. Now that I have left your country you will not be able to carry out such a plan.']"
Genesis, 31,32,"['לא יחיה. He thought that one of the servants must have stolen the teraphim in order to worship them as he had been in the habit of doing before becoming part of Yaakov’s household.', 'הכר לך מה עמדי, if you can find amongst my possessions any that you recognise as belonging to you, take them!', 'ולא ידע יעקב, if he had known that Rachel had taken the teraphim he would not have had the audacity to deny this. Also, he most certainly would not have cursed her by saying “he shall not live!” [actually he had not cursed the thief but the one with whom the stolen goods would be found, and in the event Lavan never did find the teraphim. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 31,36,"['ויחר ליעקב וירב בלבן, after Lavan did not find anything, Yaakov thought that his teraphim had never been stolen at all, but that Lavan had used the accusation as a pretext to search Yaakov’s belongings and to make him appear as a suspected thief.', '?מה פשעי מה חטאתי, What wrong have I ever committed that entitles you to treat me now as suspect of stealing?']"
Genesis, 31,38,"['רחליך ועזיך לא שכלו, you have found me as possessing the very reverse of the characteristics of a thief. Not only did I serve you faithfully, but I have treated you even better than fairness dictates. I have endeavoured with all my skill to prevent your sheep from giving birth to premature, and stillborn young.', 'ואילי צאנך לא אכלתי, even things which according to accepted practice I could have treated as mine, I did not eat, seeing that they were nominally yours.']"
Genesis, 31,39,"['לא הבאתי אליך, אנכי אחטנה, I never brought you a diseased or fatally wounded animal whose death had been due to my negligence; all I ever brought you were animals which were the victims of genuine accidents, something I could not have prevented.

Genesis, 31,41,"['ותחלף את משכרתי, by doing so you reversed yourself since it had been you who had determined what my wages should be.']"
Genesis, 31,43,"['והצאן צאני, if I had indeed changed your wages or sent you home empty-handed I would not have taken anything from you, seeing that it all originated from me.

Genesis, 31,48,"['ויאמר לבן הגל הזה עד, he humbled himself to refer to it in Hebrew, Yaakov’s language, after having named it in Aramaic first. He meant that the pile of stones would serve as a witness to what he was about to say.']"
Genesis, 31,49,"[""והמצפה also the name מצפה itself was to serve as a witness. This was because immediately prior Lavan had said יצף ה' ביני ובינך, “may G’d watch between me and you.”"", 'אשר אמר, previously.']"
Genesis, 31,50,"['ראה אלוקים עד, look that G’d will punish you if you do not treat my daughters properly, seeing He is a witness The whole line may be understood as analogous to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.5.21"" data-ref=""Leviticus 5:21"">Leviticus 5,21</a>, ומעלה מעל בה\', where the trespass against G’d is considered as something that only G’d is aware of, there being no human witnesses at hand to testify against the sinner. G’d is always the third party when two people have a disagreement, seeing He knows the true facts of the situation.']"
Genesis, 31,53,"['אלוהי אביהם, Lavan meant that Yaakov could not take offence at Lavan pairing Nachor’s god and Yaakov’s G’d in a single expression. He had chosen Nachor to underline that Nachor’s god was also the god of Terach, who was the father of both Avraham and Nachor.', 'וישבע יעקב בפחד אביו יצחק. He chose someone who was not the son of Terach to make certain it was understood that his oath was only to the G’d of Yitzchok. Only this G’d was entitled to judge him.']"
Genesis, 31,54,"['ויקרא לאחיו, of Lavan. There was no need to invite Lavan himself seeing he was like a father to Yaakov’s children.']"
Genesis, 32,1,"['ויברך אתהם. Our sages have already told us not to belittle the value of a blessing pronounced by a layman, a person of low social standing. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Megillah.15"" data-ref=""Megillah 15"">Megillah 15</a>) The reason why the Torah tells us of Lavan’s blessing to his daughters is to remind us that when a father blesses his sons he does so wholeheartedly, with his material and spiritual faculties. We know that Yitzchok blessed with all his soul from his own words (27,4) When the one bestowing the blessing himself reflects the image of G’d he had been created in, then such a blessing is likely to be correspondingly more effective.']"
Genesis, 32,3,"['מחנה אלוקים זה. Now that the angels have seen fit to join me there can be no doubt that mine is a godly camp. Just as Yaakov had called the place where he had had the dream of the ladder Bet El, so he now referred to his camp as machaneh elokim. In either instance the reason was that he had been found worthy of a divine revelation.', 'מחנים, two camps; the camp of G’d (angels) and his own. The grammatical formulation with the plural ending following the vowel patach, the stress is on the penultimate syllable as this indicated the number 2. Parallel examples are paamayim, shevuayim, shenatayim, etc. .[the kametz here substitutes for the patach as it is the end of the sentence. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 32,4,"['וישלח יעקב מלאכים, in order to find out Esau’s state of mind concerning him.', 'ארצה שעיר שדה אדום, to the region of Seir where he lived. At that time he had not yet conquered the whole Chori, the inhabitants of that land. (compare 36,8)']"

But, אגם הולך לקראתך עם ארבע מאות איש, he also marches toward you with 400 men in order to attack you. The expression לקראת meaning to approach with hostile intent is repeated in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.20.20"" data-ref=""Numbers 20:20"">Numbers 20,20</a> when again Edom (Esau) is threatening the Israelites.']"
Genesis, 32,9,"['והיה המחנה הנשאר לפלטה, while he will be busy gorging himself on the loot captured in the first camp the second camp will be able to make good its escape, or will have prepared itself for battle.']"
Genesis, 32,10,"['אלוקי אבי אברהם, Yaakov first listed the praises of the Lord, acknowledging His deeds of loving kindness, before coming to the point of pleading for His help in his hour of need. When the sages of the Great Assembly formulated our daily prayers they followed the example set by Yaakov here in devoting the first three benedictions to praising the Lord and acknowledging both His power and His Holiness, before launching into listing our requests from Him.']"
Genesis, 32,11,"['קטונתי מכל החסדים, I was not worthy of all the acts of kindness I have experienced at Your hands.', 'ומכל האמת, the good You did for me on account of the merit of my father and grandfather. Seeing that You have already seen fit to treat me well beyond my deserts, I beg of You to continue to do so. Our regular prayers reflect this sentiment when we use the expression כגודל חסדך, “in accordance with the greatness of Your kindness.” Moses used this expression in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.14.19"" data-ref=""Numbers 14:19"">Numbers 14,19</a> when praying for forgiveness of the people after the debacle with the spies.']"
Genesis, 32,12,"['<b>Mother and children alike.</b> Literally, “he will strike me, mother with sons” — i.e. he would deal Yaakov a devastating blow by killing his family, even if he himself escaped.']"

It behooves You to let them survive for the sake of Your great name, even if I myself do not deserve to survive.

Genesis, 32,17,"['עדר עדר לבדו. In order for Esau to realise that each species of animals had the appropriate number of males with it to ensure that these herds would continue to develop without hindrance. This is what he meant when he urged Esau קח נא את ברכתי, “please accept my blessing” (33,11) He meant that his gift was designed to be an ongoing blessing for his brother.', 'וריוח תשימו בין עדר לעדר, to prevent the animals form one herd to jump into the adjoining herd, so that anyone seeing this gift would not appreciate its quality and scope.']"
Genesis, 32,19,"['ואמרת: ""לעבדך ליעקב"". He instructed his shepherds not to give the impression that they knew Esau was on the way in their direction and that they had been sent to him. The phrasing Yaakov instructed his messengers to use was meant to give the impression that Yaakov had no knowledge that Esau was marching toward him with hostile intentions. The messenger should give the impression that he had been sent by Yaakov to Seir where Esau lived, with a gift for him.']"
Genesis, 32,20,"['כדבר הזה תדברון אל עשו, he instructed each one what to reply to Esau’s enquiry. He should simply mention that he belonged to the other herds following him, all of them being Yaakov’s a gift for his older brother Esau.']"
Genesis, 32,21,"['ואמרתם גם הנה עבדך יעקב אחרינו, he told each of them to reply with the same words in addition to the words that each one had been instructed to answer individually. The purpose behind these detailed instructions was to convince Esau that Yaakov was indeed not far behind on his way to Seir the destination of these gifts which he had sent ahead of him.', 'כי אמר אכפרה פניו במנחה, these were the words he had instructed the shepherds leading the gift to say, in order to soften Esau’s attitude by Yaakov assuming a somewhat servile attitude prior to their coming face to face with one another.', 'אראה פניו, an expression denoting the “paying of a visit,” as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.23"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:23"">Exodus 34,23</a> where the Jewish people is instructed to visit the Temple three times annually with the same formula, i.e. יראה כל זכורך...ולא יראו פני ריקם, “every male of you is to visit Me; when they pay this visit they shall not come empty-handed.” Yaakov himself confirmed the meaning of the formula אראה פניך when he said to Esau in 33,10 על כן ראיתי פניך כראות פני אלוקים, “inasmuch as visiting you is akin to visiting the presence of G’d.” It was an accepted custom for a visitor to highly placed persons to arrive bearing gifts.']"

Genesis, 32,25,"['ויותר יעקב לבדו, he was the last one to leave from the camp as he was busy directing all his family and servants and chattels to cross the fording so that nothing would be left behind.', 'ויאבק איש עמו, this was the work of an angel at the instigation of G’d (that is why he is called איש). The description is parallel to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.13.17"" data-ref=""II Kings 13:17"">Kings II 13,17</a> It is immaterial whether the instrument of the salvation is a merely symbolic one such as the arrows described in the Book of Kings which Elisha instructed King Yoash to shoot in the direction of the far away Kingdom of Aram. Salvation occurs at the end of a period of ups and downs, and though Yaakov/Israel suffered many reverses in his struggle with Esau, (in the historical global struggle between the two philosophies) in the end Yaakov triumphs. [freely translated as the author is ambiguous to my mind. Ed.] The blessing given by the angel here to Yaakov at the end of the struggle, at daybreak, symbolises the synopsis of Jewish history.']"
Genesis, 32,26,"['לא יכול לו, seeing that most of Yaakov’s striving was oriented toward G’d and heavenly concerns. Both his thinking and his conversation had G’d and His will as its focus.

Genesis, 32,29,"['לא יעקב יאמר עוד שמך, a reference to the end of days when Israel will have survived the destruction of the gentile nations When that time comes no one ever will again use the name Yaakov for the Jewish people [and the stigma that used to be associated with that name.

Genesis, 32,32,"['<b>The sun shone upon him.</b> This verse must be inverted — after he passed Penuel, still limping, the sun shone and healed him. Similarly, in the time to come the “sun” of the redemption will shine and heal the righteous.']"
Genesis, 32,33,"['על כן לא יאכלו בני ישראל, in order to ensure that the damage inflicted to Yaakov’s offspring as predicted by the angel should be kept to a minimum as long as they remind themselves of the symbolic meaning of that injury suffered by Yaakov during his nocturnal encounter with this angel.

Ed.] Alternatively, the moral lesson is that just as the gid hanashe is totally devoid of taste, does not appeal to the palate, so that consuming it would not provide the sinner with any kind of gratification, we are taught not to second-guess G’d’s legislation by treating this commandment as not important.']"

Genesis, 33,4,"['וירץ עשו, his attitude changed suddenly when he realised to what extent Yaakov had humbled himself before him. It is of great concern to us seeing that we live among the descendants of Esau, people who are arrogant, consider themselves invincible. Yaakov’s conduct vis a vis Esau teaches that the only way to escape the sword of Esau is through self degradation and gifts. This corresponds to what our sages taught us (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Taanit.20"" data-ref=""Taanit 20"">Taanit 20</a>) that the curses of the prophet Achiyah Hashiloni were more beneficial to the Jewish people than the blessing showered upon them by Bileam.

Genesis, 34,6,"['ויצא חמור, when he noticed that Yaakov’s reaction had been silence he began to worry about reprisals.']"
Genesis, 34,7,"['ויתיצבו האנשים ויחר, the sadness and sorrow described by the Torah as the brothers’ reaction pertained to the despicable deed that had been perpetrated against a member of Yisrael’s family. This was in spite of the fact that whereas Jews do not rape unmarried virgins, gentiles are known to be guilty of this. Seeing that even in gentile circles it was taboo to rape the daughters of prominent citizens, the Torah adds the words וכן לא יעשה, that such a thing was totally unacceptable. Their anger, ויחר, therefore was turned against the perpetrators and against those who had condoned the act.']"
Genesis, 34,10,"['וסחרוה,. Event though normally, newcomers were not allowed to engage in the kind of commerce or artisanship which would compete with that practiced by the local inhabitants. We have this principle in Baba Batra 21, where it is spelled out as the right of the local inhabitant who feels economically threatened by competition from a new immigrant. He is accorded the right to lodge a complaint against the newcomer practicing his trade in his town. [an ancient form of the policy of “closed shop.” Ed.]']"
Genesis, 34,12,"['הרבה עלי מאד, as a penance he would be prepared to pay over and above the customary amount of a dowry.']"
Genesis, 34,13,"['במרמה, they demanded that the people circumcise themselves expecting them to refuse. Alternatively, they thought that Shechem and Chamor, although prepared themselves to circumcise themselves, would not be able to convince the townsfolk to follow their example.', 'וידברו, אשר טמא; they said that the kind of ipso facto voluntary circumcision which Shechem and his father were willing to perform on themselves was not relevant after Shechem had already defiled their sister. They considered this as in the category of אתנן זונה, offering the price paid to a whore as a sacrifice on G’d’s altar.']"

Genesis, 34,21,"['שלמים הם אתנו, they are of a totally peaceful disposition towards us. They do not intend to revenge themselves for the indignity their family has suffered.']"
Genesis, 34,25,"['ויהרגו כל זכר, these men had not circumcised themselves in order to become Jews and embrace monotheism but only in order to lay their hands on the vast possessions of the family of Yaakov, as their leaders Chamor and Shechem had promised them.']"

Genesis, 34,27,"['העיר אשר טמאו, unless according to the mores of Shechem (city) such behaviour was no longer considered despicable, Schechem would not have done what he did. He felt sure he could get away with it, as his townspeople would not object. However raping virgins was commonplace in Shechem already. They behaved in the manner described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.6.2"" data-ref=""Genesis 6:2"">Genesis 6,2</a> “they took women for themselves from wherever they chose.” [the punishment for this type of violence had been the deluge.

It is incumbent upon us to avenge her disgrace. Once the inhabitants of the region will understand this they will have no reason to attack us.”']"
Genesis, 35,1,"['ושב שם. An invitation to prepare himself mentally and spiritually before beginning to build the altar that he had in mind to erect.

He wanted all his people to mentally completely dissociate themselves from anything connected wit items formerly used in idolatrous pursuits.']"
Genesis, 35,4,"['ויטמון אותם יעקב, he buried them instead of destroying them. Seeing that they no longer had the halachic status of being idolatrous artifacts they did not need to be destroyed ']"

Genesis, 35,9,"['וירא אלוקים, after the mourning had concluded.', ' The Torah, in retrospect, by using this formulation, tells us that the dream Yaakov had had when in flight, on the way to Charan, had in fact not been merely a dream but a vision.', 'בבאו מפדן ארם. G’d only appeared to him after leaving Lavan. While he was in Lavan’s city he did not rate such visions. The fact that G’d had spoken to him by means of an intermediary, an angel even while still in Padan Aram, is not to be confused with the level of a vision described as “G’d appeared to him.”']"
Genesis, 35,10,"['שמך יעקב, at this time I make your name Yaakov an eternal name, i.e. after all the other nations will have perished you alone will remain.

Genesis, 35,12,"['ולזרעך אחריך אתן את הארץ, in due course, at the end of time, I will give your descendants the entire globe, not only the land of Israel.

Genesis, 35,14,"['ויסך עליו נסך, he poured a libation of wine on it. Thereby he completed paying his vow in which he had vowed to make out of the stone which had served as his pillow a monument, meaning “a house of G’d.” (28,22). By anointing this monument he had, so to speak, laid the foundation of the house of G’d to be built there in the future. What he did here was similar to what David did in his time when he prepared the foundation for the Temple his son Solomon was to build after his death in accordance with what the angel had told him at the threshing ground of Arona the Jebusite.']"

Genesis, 35,23,"['בכור יעקב ראובן, as far as Heaven was concerned Reuven did not suffer consequences because he had repented forthwith. He also did not suffer really in this world, i.e. on earth, until on his deathbed Yaakov punished him by depriving him of the material benefits enjoyed by the first born in that he inherits an extra share of his father’s estate.

Genesis, 36,1,"['ואלה תולדות, a reference to developments in the clan started by Esau, both in people, possessions and political influence.

[the author interprets this as the justification for the Torah repeating this information which we had been given in already 25,30. Ed.] The overpowering desire of Esau for what attracted his eye was demonstrated when he could not remember the name “lentils” when he was tired, demanding to be given from “this red, red stuff.”']"
Genesis, 36,2,"['ואת אהליבמה בת ענה. She was a member of the tribe of the Chori. She became Esau’s entry card to the whole region of Mount Seir. This is why the Torah reports already in verse 8 that Esau now settled in Mount Seir. His own children and grandchildren subsequently wiped out all the other members of that tribe that had not intermarried with his descendants. This is the reason why the Torah repeats in verse 9 ואלה תולדות עשו אבי אדום בהר שעיר, to inform us obliquely that in the interval Esau had conquered all these people and that Timna became his son’s concubine. Esau’s descendants now became אלופים, “great chiefs.”']"
Genesis, 36,12,"['ותמנע היתה פלגש, Eliphaz was one of the conquerors of that land and Timna a sister of the אלופים of the original inhabitants of the region fell to him as a conquest and became his concubine.']"
Genesis, 36,20,"['אלה בני שעיר החורי, the reason the Torah lists the outstanding people of that region is to show that Esau overpowered them in spite of their prowess.

Genesis, 36,31,"['ואלה המלכים, the Torah informs us that the Edomites had to appoint outsiders, members of other tribes, as their kings, seeing that they did not find a suitable personage for such a task among their own.

Genesis, 36,40,"['ואלה שמות אלופי עשו, the significance of the additional words למקומותם בשמותם may be that they were not distinguished enough to be recorded by their individual names, but only in association with the location where they practiced their authority.']"
Genesis, 37,1,"['וישב יעקב בארץ מגורי אביו בארץ כנען. In the same region of the land of Canaan in which his father had sojourned. Compare a similar verse in 35,27 אשר גר שם אברהם ויצחק, “where Avraham and Yitzchok had sojourned.”']"
Genesis, 37,2,"['אלה תולדות יעקב, what happened to him, as a result of his “settling,” i.e. “retiring” there. (matters which he had not planned). Things described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.27.1"" data-ref=""Proverbs 27:1"">Proverbs 27,1</a> as ילדי יום, brought on by the passage of time. Ever since Yaakov had left his father’s home what happened to him had the appearance of something not planned by him, not the result of his design. It is similar to the history of the Jewish people during the era of the first Temple. At any rate, the words וישב יעקב, Yaakov setlled down, remind us of the Jewish people in the land of Israel until the first expulsion. The words בארץ מגורי אביו, in the land where his father had been a stranger, remind us of the era of second Temple. This was followed by the destruction of Jewish statehood, and the loss of even the status of a satellite power, and our entering a long period of exile which will terminate only with the final redemption.', 'היה רועה את אחיו בצאן, he was giving guidance to them and instructed them in the finer points of being successful shepherds.', 'והוא נער, if, in spite of this, he badmouthed his brothers, this was due to his being still an adolescent, not as mature as he should have been or as his intellect made him appear to be. He was not experienced enough to realise what the ultimate effect of his badmouthing his brothers would turn out to be. While it is true that as a relative youngster at 30 he became the mentor of the wisest men in Egypt, the foremost political power, at the tender age of 17 he still had a lot to learn. (compare his wisdom as expressed in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.105.22"" data-ref=""Psalms 105:22"">Psalms 105,22</a> where aged people are described as wise, whereas in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.89"" data-ref=""Shabbat 89"">Shabbat 89</a> we are taught that mature wisdom cannot be expected to be found amongst the physically young.', 'ויבא יוסף את דבתם רעה, he told his father that his brothers, because of unintentional errors, i.e. lack of professional competence, caused him financial losses in his flocks, seeing that at the time they were preoccupied primarily with increasing their material wealth. ']"
Genesis, 37,3,"['ועשה לו כתונת פסים, as a visible sign that Joseph was intended by him to become the leader of all the brothers both at home and in the field. The use of such distinctive clothing to symbolise someone’s elevated stature is found also in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.22.21"" data-ref=""Isaiah 22:21"">Isaiah 22,21</a> והלבשתיו כתנתך, “I will dress him (Chilkiyah) in your tunic,” where it signals that authority is transferred to the one wearing the appropriate garments. (uniform). The Talmud <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bava_Kamma.11"" data-ref=""Bava Kamma 11"">Baba Kama 11</a> also confirms that authority is signalled by the attire worn by people possessing it. [there the brothers who had paid extra for their leader to represent them and to appear well dressed are quite content seeing that their representative while attired in costly garments will indirectly confer benefits upon them through their brother being listened to in the councils of the city. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 37,4,"['ויראו אחיו כי אותו אהב אביהם, here Yaakov had committed an error, allowing the love in his heart for Joseph to be now become visible through preferential treatment of him.', 'ולא יכלו דברו לשלום, even though the brothers had to speak to Joseph pertaining to their business dealings both concerning household problems and problems with the herds and flocks, something imposed upon them by their father’s command to see in him their manager, they did not speak to him concerning any private matters, brotherly concerns.']"
Genesis, 37,5,"['ויגד לאחיו, this too was an ill advised move. Had he been more mature he would have kept the contents of such a dream to himself.']"
Genesis, 37,6,"['שמעו נא החלום הזה, not only did he tell them his dream, as something by the way, but he invited them to listen to him tell it by saying שמעו נא “please pay attention!” This could not fail to intensify the hostility of his brothers, as we see immediately by their reaction: “do you plan to rule over us?!”']"
Genesis, 37,7,"['וגם נצבה, this conveyed to him the impression that his authority would extend over a considerable length of time. In fact, it proved to be so as he ruled for 80 years. There is no record of any ruler mentioned in the Bible as having ruled equally long or longer than Joseph.']"
Genesis, 37,8,"['חלומותיו, because of his dreams. The details he told them proved to the brothers that Joseph was hoping that his dreams would be realised.', 'ועל דבריו, and on account of his having insisted that they listen to the details of what he had dreamt.']"
Genesis, 37,10,"['מה החלום הזה?, this is only a reflection of unworthy thoughts. It shows us that you plan to rule over us. Your nocturnal dreams reflect your thinking when you are awake.']"
Genesis, 37,11,"['ויקנאו בו אחיו, they attributed such aspirations by Joseph to the fact that their father had appointed them as senior to them, otherwise he would not have dared tell such dreams even in his father’s presence.', 'ואביו שמר, he remembered it because he thought that the dream reflected what would in fact occur. In fact, his father was looking forward to the fulfillment of Joseph’s dream. This reflects the statement in the <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.105"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 105"">Talmud Sanhedrin 105</a> that a person may be jealous of everyone except his students and his children.']"
Genesis, 37,13,"['הלא אחיך רועים בשכם?, Yaakov implied that it was not very far from their home to Shechem. [this seems a bit strange as it is about 100km by air, surely quite a distance for an unaccompanied young man of 17 to travel all by himself. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 37,14,"['לך נא ראה, “please go and have a first hand look, etc.” Yaakov meant that Joseph should take care of any matters which in his opinion needed to be improved in the managing of the herds.']"
Genesis, 37,15,"['תועה בשדה, walking in every direction to find where they were tending the flocks.', 'מה תבקש, what are you looking for seeing that you do not keep to the known paths?']"
Genesis, 37,16,"['איפה הם רועים, in which section of this region.']"
Genesis, 37,17,"['נסעו מזה, there is no question that they have departed from this grazing area, there is no point in searching any part of this region.', 'כי שמעתי אומרים, the reason why I said that they certainly no longer are in this region is because I myself overheard them saying “lets move on.”', 'אחר אחיו, even though he had not been able to locate them in Shechem as his father had asked him to do, he went to more trouble than he was required to, in order to fulfill the wishes of his father.']"
Genesis, 37,18,"['ויתנכלו אותו להמיתו, the root נכל always means to plan to do something evil. One example of the use of this word in this sense is found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.25.18"" data-ref=""Numbers 25:18"">Numbers 25,18</a> אשר נכלו אתכם, “who plotted against you.” The brothers had entertained the thought of causing Joseph’s death while they saw him from a distance. They did not think that he had come to make peace with them but that he was spying on them to either cause them to commit a sin which would bring their father’s curses on them or which would cause G’d to punish them. As a result of this, Joseph imagined he alone would survive as blessed of all of Yaakov’s sons. The expression ויתנכל in the reflexive conjugation described what a person fantasizes about in his mind, what imaginary scenarios he entertains in his head. You find the expression in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.28.9"" data-ref=""I Samuel 28:9"">Samuel I 28,9</a> אתה מתנקש בנפשי, “(the witch of Endor speaking to King Sha-ul who had disguised himself) “you are trying to trap me into forfeiting my life, trying to get me killed! The word להמיתו in our verse refers to Joseph causing the death of his brothers. [While it is true that the word is separated from the word אותו preceding it by the tone sign tipcha which refers to what came before, in the opinion of this Editor it should then have read להמיתם to cause their death,” instead of “to cause his death.” Ed.] We find the expression used in a similar sense in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.4.14"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 4:14"">Deuteronomy 4,14</a> לעשותכם אותם, “so that you will fulfill them.” [the author describes the function of the transitive conjugation of the root נכל and עשה respectively, not any similarity of the subject matter under discussion in the two verses mentioned. Ed.] If we understand the thoughts described in our verse in this vein, we can solve the riddle of how the stones on the breastplate of the High Priest could have been inscribed with the names of all these brothers, if instead of being as righteous as such models ought to have been in order to serve as inspiration for us, they had indeed harboured such murderous thoughts without justification. Even if the brothers’ intention to sell Joseph had been based on mere hatred, how could such brothers qualify as inspiration for the Jewish people of the breastplate of the High Priest? We must therefore endeavour to understand the collective feelings of the brothers as being that they actually felt themselves threatened by Joseph’s aspirations and they were convinced that when one feels threatened one is entitled or even obliged to take measures to neutralise the source of the danger. This is even a halachic principle clearly spelled out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.72"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 72"">Sanhedrin 72</a>. If we needed any proof for the truth of the brothers’ feelings, it is best provided by their conversation among themselves while in jail (42,21) when they felt that G’d had repaid them for their misdeeds. They did not regret selling Joseph, nor even having planned to kill him; the only thing they regretted and considered themselves guilty of was that they had not responded to Joseph’s pleas for mercy. In other words, even over 20 years after the event they were still convinced that Joseph had posed the sort of threat to their existence which entitled them to take extreme defensive action against him. ']"
Genesis, 37,19,"['הנה בעל החלומות, they meant “the one who told us about his dreams in order to make us angry.” They meant that Joseph had wanted them to commit a sin as a result of their anger so that they would bring down upon themselves the wrath of their father or of G’d. causing our destruction in either event.']"
Genesis, 37,20,"['ועתה לכו, make up your minds quickly to kill him.', 'אמרנו חיה רעה אכלתהו, so that Joseph will not have a chance of becoming angry at us and first be cursing us. ', 'ונראה מה יהיו חלומותיו, the dreams of which he told us that they foreshadow his rise to greatness and that he would rule over us.

Genesis, 37,21,"['ויצילהו מידם, by first of all preventing immediate action by the brothers, committing an act which would prove to be irrevocable. This would have been the kind of thing Solomon had in mind when he said in Kohelet 1,15 that מעוות לא יוכל לתקן, “there are things so twisted that they are beyond repair.” He referred to matters from which sometimes the righteous person can also not be saved. One such example was the irreversible act of Reuven of having slept with Bilhah. Yaakov himself characterized it as פחז כמים, “hasty like water” (flowing downstream, something beyond recall).']"
Genesis, 37,22,"['ויד אל תשלחו בו, according to your judgment that he deserves killing as a רודף, someone threatening you with death or perdition. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.24.13"" data-ref=""I Samuel 24:13"">Samuel I 24,13</a> מרשעים יצא רשע וידי לא תהיה בך, “although from wicked people come wicked deeds, my hand will never touch you. [David telling G’d that he will personally not harm his persecutor King Sha-ul, but he leaves it to G’d to deal with him. Ed.]', 'למען הציל אותו, in order to raise him from the pit afterwards.']"
Genesis, 37,25,"['וישבו לאכול לחם, to demonstrate that what they had done was no crime in their eyes, or that the incident was not something that should interfere with their regular meal. When righteous people become aware of having inadvertently committed a sin, they not only do not celebrate it by eating, but they impose a fast day or more upon themselves. A prominent example of people imposing a fast day upon themselves, although they did not feel guilty for having done something wrong, were the Jewish tribes after having practically wiped out the tribe of Binyamin. We read about this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.21.2-3"" data-ref=""Judges 21:2-3"">Judges 21,2-3</a> as well as about the fact that they imposed a fast upon themselves in spite of being convinced that they had done the right thing in going to war against that tribe. We also find something parallel when the King Darius threw Daniel into a pit full of starving lions. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Daniel.6.19"" data-ref=""Daniel 6:19"">Daniel 6,19</a>). [The King had acted in accordance with the constitution of his country which demanded that a “heretic” such as Daniel be thrown to the lions, and the king’s efforts to have the law changed were rejected by his advisers. In spite of being legally correct, the king felt so badly that he went to bed hungry as a kind of penance for doing what was legally correct. Ed.] If the brothers sat down to eat immediately after throwing Joseph into the pit, this is clear evidence that in their minds they had certainly not committed any wrong. WE, who were not part of Yaakov’s household, and who know that these brothers were unanimously elevated to become the founding fathers of the Jewish nation, must therefore accept the premise underlying their actions as being that they had truly felt themselves personally threatened by Joseph, someone who was considered so mature that his own father had appointed him as manager over his senior brothers. The brothers had made strenuous efforts to put physical distance between themselves and Joseph in order to avoid any altercation. When he had sought them out in spite of their having signaled clearly that they wanted to avoid him, they felt understandably very threatened.', 'הולכים להוריד מצרימה, these Ishmaelites were camel owners, they did not own the merchandise described which was carried by their camels. As soon as they would deliver the merchandise to the appropriate address in Egypt their mission was completed.']"
Genesis, 37,26,"['<b>What will we gain.</b> By this we will do harm not only to Yoseif but to ourselves, because we will be filled with remorse.  ', '<b>And cover up his blood.</b> Moreover, the deed will not even serve as a deterrent to our other adversaries because we will have to conceal it for our own honor and out of fear of our father.']"
Genesis, 37,27,"['לכו ונמכרנו, and this will be an appropriate measure for measure punishment for him; he wanted to make slaves out of us; now he himself will become a slave.']"
Genesis, 37,28,"['מדינים סוחרים, the owners of the merchandise being transported on the Ishmaelites’ camels.', 'וימכרו את יוסף לישמעאלים, they completed the deal with the Ishmaelites acting as agents for the Midianites. The brothers did not want to speak to the Midianite merchants. The reason was that they did not want to be recognised by them as they were in the habit of frequenting cities in order to ply their wares. The camel drovers, however, were not in the habit of visiting urban areas. At worst they would just pass through towns without stopping there overnight or longer. The actual purchasers, however, were the Midianite merchants, in accordance with the Torah’s narrative that the Midianites sold Joseph to Egypt (verse 36). The Jewish people experienced something parallel during the period of the second Temple, when Midianites sold a portion of our people into slavery to surrounding nations, a phenomenon which was widespread during the time when the descendants of the Hasmoneans were fighting among themselves about who would be king in Jerusalem. This fratricide is responsible for our exile until this day. It was a historical replay of what happened as a result of the brothers selling Joseph, and the whole family winding up in exile in Egypt only a few years later.

Genesis, 37,35,"['וימאן להתנחם, he refused to listen to words of comfort in order not to become guilty of forgetting to mourn.', 'ויאמר כי ארד אל בני אבל שאולה, he vowed to remain in mourning for the balance of his life. His reason was that he blamed himself for what happened because he had sent his beloved son on such a dangerous errand.', 'ויבך אותו אביו. Yitzchok wept over Yaakov’s decision to remain in mourning for the rest of his life. As a result of being in mourning he would forfeit Divine inspiration also.']"
Genesis, 38,1,"['ויהי בעת ההיא, והמדנים מכרו אותו, [the Torah contrasts the facts with the perception of the facts, i.e. Joseph was alive but the Midianites had sold him. I believe that this is why the author quotes the beginning of this verse without elaborating on it at all. He leaves it to our imagination to fill in this next item in the tragic chain of errors beginning with the fact that Yitzchok had shown more love for Esau. Ed.] at about the same time when Joseph was sold to Egypt at the suggestion of Yehudah who had proposed this instead of bringing him back to his father and had thereby bereaved his father, Yehudah reaped some of the fruit of his ill advised plans, in that the way was paved for him to be bereaved of two of his own sons in due course.']"

[I am not sure if the author understood the Torah as using to the word כזיב to describe Yehudah’s state of mind, and that there was no such place at all. Ed.] Had he been there, he would never have agreed to the name she gave his son.']"

Genesis, 38,9,"['כי לא לו יהיה הזרע, he knew that not he alone would get the credit for performing this act of love for his deceased brother, seeing that part of the merit would go to his older brother seeing he had first fulfilled the commandment of marrying, so that he would share in the merit of having a son sired posthumously through a levirate union with his widow by his younger brother. [I fail to understand how someone who married in order to use sex only as an act of self-gratification can be described as having acquired a merit by the act of marrying. Perhaps gratifying the sex urge only with someone to whom one is married is by itself a מצוה, and this is what Seforno had in mind.

Genesis, 38,16,"['כי לא ידע כי כלתו היא, he did not even recognise her after he joined her in her private quarters. Had he recognised her he would surely have spoken to her concerning why he had not given her to his surviving son.

Immediately she had done what she meant to do she resumed living as a widow as I had told her to do. My seeking her out to let her have the goat I had promised her was meant only to ensure that my good image would be preserved. This in itself is not a worthy cause.

Genesis, 42,2,"['ונחיה, even if we cannot buy enough food to eat to our satisfaction, at least it will be enough not to die from the famine. This is why Yaakov added the words ולא נמות, “and we will not die.”']"
Genesis, 42,3,"['וירדו אחי יוסף עשרה, the official selling grain in Egypt did not sell to more than one family per buyer. The reason for this restriction was intended to ensure that the buyers would not resell some or all of what they had bought, thus using what Joseph had stored as a source of enriching themselves.']"
Genesis, 42,5,"['בתוך הבאים, people traveled together in large groups to afford themselves protection against highway robbers. At that time there were more than the usual amount of these. They would rob both the money carried to buy food and the food itself']"
Genesis, 42,6,"['<b>He was the one who sold.</b> He did not trust his servants with the task because the sums involved were too great.', '<b>Yoseif’s brothers came.</b> Because Yoseif sold the grain personally the brothers were forced to come before him.']"
Genesis, 42,7,"['ויכירם, he recognised them collectively as being his brothers, without being able to recognise who each brother was.', 'ויתנכר אליהם, he adopted a manner totally uncharacteristic of him, by speaking arrogantly, masking his true voice, etc, apart from the fact that he spoke to them in Egyptian having everything he said translated into Hebrew by an interpreter.', 'קשות, so that they would not recognise his voice.']"
Genesis, 42,8,"['ויכר יוסף את אחיו, now he recognised them each individually']"
Genesis, 42,9,"['ויזכור יוסף את החלמות אשר חלם להם. He remembered the part his brothers had played in his dreams, how they had bowed down to him in the dream showing the sheaves of corn. (37,7) He remembered that only his own sheaf had remained erect, and not fallen after first having arisen. This is why he wanted that they would all come when he would recognise them and the part in the dream speaking of the upright sheaf remaining upright would be fulfilled also. This detail of the dream was due to Joseph symbolising the redeemer of the Jewish people in the future as portrayed by the words ירה ויור, “shoot!, and he shot”. in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.13.17"" data-ref=""II Kings 13:17"">Kings II 13,17</a>.

Genesis, 42,11,"['כלנו בני איש אחד יחנו, if we were spies we would have to be in the employ of some king. No king would select as his spies all members of the same family. The only reason why we arrived together is because we are all members of the same family.', 'כנים אנחנו, not only are we 100% above board in all our dealings, but ', 'לא היו עבדיך מרגלים, we have never been spies in the past either, and there is no reason at all of suspecting us to be spies now.']"
Genesis, 42,12,"['לא. It is simply not true that you are brothers.', 'כי ערות הארץ באתם לראות, you have agreed among your selves to claim to be brothers so that this would provide you with a pretext to act as spies in the land and to find weak spots in our security system.']"
Genesis, 42,13,"['שנים עשר עבדיך אחים, בני איש אחד בארץ כנען, what we have said before can easily be proven. After all, our father is still alive in the land of Canaan. Both he and his neighbours will confirm what we have told you, i.e. that we used to be twelve brothers, that one went missing, and that the youngest remained to look after the affairs of our father’s household. You can confirm that we have spoken the truth by checking out all these details.']"
Genesis, 42,14,"['הוא אשר דברתי אליכם, the very one of whom you have said that he is no longer, whereas you refused to be specific about what happened to him, is the one who went back to report all that you have seen here, or that you have decided to stay a while in order to engage in spying.']"
Genesis, 42,15,"['בזאת תבחנו, if he is not your brother, the youngest one of whom you spoke will not endanger his own life to come with you and to share your fate of the death penalty.']"

Genesis, 42,20,"['ולא תמותו, he meant that they would not die here, as he was able to have them killed also in the land of Canaan if they would not come back of their own free will.']"
Genesis, 42,21,"['בהתחננו אלינו ולא שמעבו. This made us guilty of being cruel against our brother, even though we considered him halachically in the category of a רודף, someone threatening us. We should have reacted with pity once he started pleading with us. Now, we are being punished by being treated cruelly ourselves by the ruler of this land.']"
Genesis, 42,22,"['הלא אמרתי אליכם אל תחטאו בילד?. He had never intended to cause your death when he had done what he did, as you had imagined. His actions were due to the fact that he was immature, was childish.', 'וגם דמו הנה נדרש. The sin we are being punished for now is not only our cruelty, as you think, but also his blood, if your actions were the cause of his death, seeing that he was innocent. There can be little doubt that he died in the performance of his tasks as a slave, something he had not been equipped to cope with.']"

Genesis, 42,25,"['ולהשיב את כספיהם, and to restore their money. The plural mode in the word does not apply to the collective term כסף, money, but to the coins which together made up the money.']"
Genesis, 42,28,"['מה זאת עשה אלוקים לנו?. Why would G’d put such ideas in the heart of a person (the ruler) who described himself as “G’d-fearing?” This is also why later, after the goblet had been found in the sack of Binyamin, the brothers offered themselves as slaves to Joseph, feeling that this would be the appropriate punishment for their having sold Joseph into slavery. (43,18). Still, they felt that selling Joseph had not been intended to be detrimental to him; rather seeing they had considered themselves endangered by him as a רודף, they considered this at the time as mild compared to killing him, which they thought they were entitled to do. The very fact that they had not killed him at the time they had considered as proof of their brotherly love']"
Genesis, 42,36,"['עלי היו כלנה, none of these incidents has befallen you, whereas all of them have befallen me. It is therefore clear that the reason these tragedies have all befallen me must be your quarrels with one another. Therefore you are to blame for my being bereaved.']"
Genesis, 42,37,"['את שני בני תמית, he cursed (conditionally) now two of his sons that they should die if he would not bring back Binyamin safely. The matter is similar to an incident related in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.108"" data-ref=""Shabbat 108"">Shabbat 108</a> where Rav said to Shemuel “may it be G’d’s will …that your children will not live.” The curse came true. [The story is extremely enigmatic, seeing that Rav who had thought that Shemuel had treated him not only in a miserly fashion, but had caused him physical discomfort deliberately, had become aware in good time that Shemuel, an outstanding physician, had done what he did in order to relieve an ailment Rav had clearly been suffering from. In spite of this, the conditional curse was fulfilled, much as Yaakov who had cursed the thief who had stolen Lavan’s teraphim not knowing that it had been Rachel. Although the condition had been that if the thief would be found he should not live, Rachel died in spite of the thief (she herself) never having been found. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 42,38,['<b>My son.</b> Yaakov refers to Binyamin in this way because he was the only son left from his primary wife [Rochel].']
Genesis, 43,2,"['שובו שברו לנו, for he thought that their intent in wanting to take Binyamin with them was in order to lose him as they had lost Joseph. He had previously accused them of bereaving him (deliberately) when he had said (42,36) אותי שכלתם, “you have bereaved me,” (transitive active conjugation). He meant to deny that what they had told him at the time had been the truth.']"
Genesis, 43,8,"['ונחיה, a reference to the food.', 'ולא נמות, as a result of actions taken by the ruler of Egypt who had told us “so that the truth of your words can be established and you will not die.” (42,20)']"
Genesis, 43,10,"['כי לולא התמהמנו, the reason I volunteered to consider myself as having sinned against you forever if I fail to bring back Binyamin is only because it is absolutely clear to me that if we had not procrastinated ever since we told you what the man had said to us, or since we ran out of food,', 'כי עתה שבנו זה פעמים, we could have been back already twice for the man would not have detained us at all, seeing that he described himself as G’d-fearing. He would not continue to harass us once he realised that we had told him the truth.']"
Genesis, 43,11,"['אם כן, if the matter is indeed as you have said that although the man harassed you he is a G’d-fearing individual,', 'איפוא, then it is quite clear what you have to do;', 'קחו מזמרת הארץ מעט צרי, although when one presents a gift to an ordinary person it is important to impress him with the quantity of the gift so that he can feast his eyes on it, this man who has everything will only be impressed with the quality of the gift instead of the quantity; therefore take rare items but only in appropriately small quantities to emphasise their rareness. All the items sent to Joseph were of this nature, as opposed to the gift Yaakov had sent to his brother Esau on a previous occasion.', 'הורידוהו לאיש מנחה, before you will actually meet him face to face again. This will enable you to judge if he receives your gift with goodwill. If he does, you will have reason to be confident that he will receive you also with goodwill. This thought has also been expressed in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.13.23"" data-ref=""Judges 13:23"">Judges 13,23</a> when the wife of Manoach, in trying to calm her husband’s fears, said to him: “if G’d had wanted to kill us He would not have accepted our burnt-offering and our gift-offering first.” After this conversation,']"

Up until now Joseph had been in a location where he conducted state business.', 'כי אתי יאכלו, he invited them to a meal in order to observe how they related to Binyamin, and to test them how they would react when he would shower gifts of so much greater value on Binyamin']"

Genesis, 43,27,"['השלום? is he well (healthy) in body? Physical health consists of opposite forces in the body being in perfect balance with one another. [hence the word שלום, “being at peace, being in perfect harmony,” is an acceptable word for describing physical health. Ed.]', 'אביכם הזקן אשר אמרתם, I am asking, seeing that it is not frequent that aged people are in physically good health.

This was Joseph’s way of showing that he considered Binyamin as equal to all of them combined. [the author was at pains to justify why Joseph gave Binyamin five times as much, not 4 times or 6 times, for instance. Ed.] ', 'וישכרו עמו, they were being served the kind of wines drunk by Royalty, something they were not used to, so that it made them drunk.

Even though Joseph was in a position to allocate generous rations to the members of his family, he did not show them any preference and treated them on the basis of need, each family according to the number of souls. Our sages have stated that at a time when the general population suffers shortage even those who have ample are to limit themselves.']"
Genesis, 47,14,"['ויבא יוסף את הכסף ביתה פרעה, because he did not permit himself to recompense himself on his own accord without being given his compensation by Pharaoh']"

It was to be eaten but one should not stuff oneself on it. This is the proper way to conduct oneself during periods of famine. There is a saying that if one starves oneself a little during periods of famine he avoids dying an unnatural death Physicians confirm the reverse of this when they said that if someone overeats after starving for a period, he contracts a potentially fatal illness.', 'בשנה ההיא, after they money had run out, the sixth year of the famine.']"
Genesis, 47,18,"['בשנה השנית, the second year after the money had run out. This was the seventh year of the famine.', 'לא נכחד מאדוני, that we still possess some livestock, כי אם תם הכסף ומקנה הבהמה. ']"

Considering that he will keep his part of the bargain, he is entitled to keep the remaining fifth for himself.']"
Genesis, 47,26,"['וישם אותה יוסף לחק, Joseph anchored this arrangement in a law after he had convinced the people that this did not represent a new hardship for them.']"
Genesis, 47,29,"['אל נא תקברני במצרים, even temporarily, in a coffin, as was done with Joseph (50,26). Yaakov reasoned that if he allowed himself to be interred even temporarily, Joseph would never be allowed to take his remains to the land of Canaan at a later date. They would argue that the honour done to him and burial in the soil of Egypt was adequate as it had been for the most outstanding kings. [we must understand the preoccupation the Egyptians had with the cult of death and what they presumed to be their afterlife. The whole culture of that people revolved around burial, hence the pyramids. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 47,30,"['ושכבתי עם אבותי, the matter of “the deceased lying with his fathers,” is the placing the bier with the deceased at the place of the eulogy, surrounded by the mourners and those eulogising him. This is why the same expression is used throughout the Book of Kings, whether describing the burial of kings, the righteous, or the wicked. ', 'ונשאתני ממצרים, when you will follow this procedure you will be able to carry me out of Egypt, for when the days of lying in state will have come to an end, people will no longer be in a state of sorrow over my passing, as we know from 50,4 ויעברו ימי בכיתו, and no one will protest if you will transport my remains to another country.', 'אנכי אעשה כדברך, I will do this on my own, making every effort to fulfill your command.']"

Genesis, 48,2,"['וישב על המטה. He did this in order to pay his respects to the presence of “Royalty” in his house to the extent that he was able to under, the circumstances, considering that he was bedridden.

Genesis, 48,4,"['ונתתיך לקהל עמים ונתתי את הארץ, at the time Yaakov received this promise all his sons with the exception of Binyamin had already been born, and G’d had already said to me when I left on the way to Charan (in the dream of the ladder) “the land which you lie on I shall give to you and to your descendants.” (28,13) If so, it had been G’d’s intention at that time already to give me a “community of nations, i.e. separate tribes. Seeing that you and your children are my descendants and it is unreasonable to assume that G’d had had only you personally in mind when speaking of קהל עמים, a community of nations, it is clear to me that I have the right to designate both these sons of yours as being part of this concept קהל, i.e. that each of them will become a founding father of one of these tribes which constitute this community of nations. ']"
Genesis, 48,5,"['ועתה שני בניך הנולדים לך....לי הם, G’d gave me only these two sons of yours together with you. Yaakov had confirmed his meaning when he said that just as he had not expected to see Joseph again he had also not expected to live to see two of his sons. (verse 11)']"
Genesis, 48,6,"['ומולדתך אשר הולדת אחריהם, your grandchildren, who are truly called מולדתך, seeing that this expression includes children and grandchildren,לך יהיו, they will be known as part of בית יוסף, the house of Joseph, bearing your name. And their blessing will be part of your blessing, not separate blessings.על שם אחיהם יקראו בנחלתם, everyone of Menashe’s sons will also incorporate the name of his father Menashe, as will the sons of his brother, who will also incorporate the name of their father Ephrayim as part of their individual names. They were to inherit part of the land of Israel together with Yaakov’s other sons.']"
Genesis, 48,7,"['ואני, maybe you think that when G’d said to me: “I will make you into a community of nations,” that He meant that I myself would become the father of more sons but that I was denied those on account of some sin, this cannot be because ', 'בבואי מפדן, when I came away from Padan Aram, when G’d appeared to me, ', 'מתה עלי רחל, as the sages say (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.22"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 22"">Sanhedrin 22</a>) a woman’s death is felt first and foremost by her husband; [hence the justification for Yaakov saying עלי, “for me,” i.e. the loss was mine. Ed.]', 'בדרך בעוד כברת ארץ לבא אפרתה, immediately after G’d finished speaking to me before I had even arrived at Beyt Lechem, ואקברה שם בדרך אפרת, and I had to bury her there on the route to Efrat; I was so overcome by grief at the time that I did not even have the strength to transport her remains to the burial grounds in Beyt Lechem. There is no doubt that ever since her death my heart was so full of grief that my libido had completely ceased to be active and I would not have been able to sire more children and to thereby become dirtied by sin, even if I had felt the desire to do so. [The author describes the act of procreation as “sinful,” meaning that even among the most pious, the act of ejaculating is itself accompanied by some impure thought, a degree of physical gratification. Ed.]. ']"
Genesis, 48,8,"['וירא ישראל את בני יוסף, he recognised them as human beings, but did not recognise them for who they were.']"
Genesis, 48,9,"['בני הם אשר נתן לי אלוקים בזה. My sons, but not my grandsons. These are the sons G’d granted me while I was here, alone, without any member of my family. as you said when you spoke about “those whom you had before I came to Egypt.” They are the ones of whom you said: “לי הם,” “they are mine.”']"
Genesis, 48,10,"['לא יוכל לראות, he could not see clearly. In order for a blessing to take hold it is necessary for the one bestowing the blessing to see the party whom he blesses at the time the blessing is pronounced. [the same is true of a curse, this is why Balak took Bileam to a vantage point from which he could see the people of Israel whom he had been hired to curse, clearly. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.13"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:13"">Numbers 23,13</a>). G’d also took Moses to a point from which he could see the land of Israel clearly so that he could bless the land. Something similar occurred in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.2.24"" data-ref=""II Kings 2:24"">Kings II 2,24</a> where Elisha turned around to face the lads mocking his baldness before he cursed them.', 'וישק להם ויחבק להם, the physical contact was designed to make Yaakov more attached to them so that his blessing would be correspondingly more effective.']"
Genesis, 48,11,"['גם את זרעך, the ones to whom the description קהל עמים applied. (verse 4) Yaakov continued (perhaps not audibly); this is when He said to me that He blessed me, i.e. Yaakov had repeated this blessing by G’d in his conversation to Joseph without being that specific. [I had to paraphrase this to make the author intelligible. Ed.] As a result of that blessing which I received, my blessing to you now will be effective, so that by blessing his sons he also blessed Joseph at the same time.']"
Genesis, 48,12,"['מעם ברכיו, of his father, who was embracing them.']"
Genesis, 48,14,"['שיכל את ידיא, he was quite clear, relying on his sense of touch, without being able to see exactly where his hands came to rest.']"
Genesis, 48,15,"['<b>He blessed Yoseif.</b> Scripture does not relate the contents of this blessing.', '<b>And said.</b> <i>After</i> he blessed Yoseif.', '<b>The God.</b> You, O Elokim before whom my fathers walked, do this in their merit', 'האלוקים הרועה אותי, the same G’d Who has acted as my own shepherd, i.e. “You Who have shown me so much love.”']"
Genesis, 48,16,"['המלאך הגואל אותי מכל רע יברך, the letter ה introducing the word המלאך is not a definitive article, identifying a specific angel [seeing that we had not previously heard about him; Ed] but acts as an appeal, instruction to such angel(s) who in the past on different occasions had been Yaakov’s guardian angels(s). Yaakov appeals to his own guardian angels to bless the children if their own merit does not suffice for the guardian angels assigned to them to do the job.', 'ויקרא בהם שמי ושם אבותי אברהם ויצחק. Although we know that Avraham and Yitzchok were both Yaakov’s fathers, he meant to make plain that he did not appeal to the god of Terach or Nachor who were similarly his “fathers” in the sense of being his ancestors. It is an axiom throughout Scripture that the righteous are never linked to those of their ancestors who were wicked, i.e. idolaters. The same is true in reverse as our sages say in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.52"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 52"">Sanhedrin 52</a>, (but not found there) קרינן לרשיעא אפילו בר צדיקא רשיעא בר רשיעא, “a wicked person, even if he is the son of a righteous person is still called a wicked person son of a wicked person.” This principle is invoked in order to save the righteous father the embarrassment of being associated with his son who has turned from the path of righteousness. When the ancestry of such a wicked person requires to be mentioned, one prefers to link him to another wicked person in his lineage. This is why Yaakov prayed for the lads that they should remain G’d fearing and prepared to serve Him. If they were to do this they would qualify to be described as offspring of Avraham and Yitzchok. This principle is known as יחד לבבי ליראה את ה\', “let my heart be undivided in reverence for Your name.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.86.11"" data-ref=""Psalms 86:11"">Psalms 86,11</a>)']"
Genesis, 48,18,"['כי זה הבכור. שים נא ידך על ראשו. Once he would place his hand on the head of Menashe, Joseph felt sure that his father’s mind would follow the direction of his hand. This has been illustrated in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.27.23"" data-ref=""Numbers 27:23"">Numbers 27,23</a> when Moses placed his hands on Joshua when appointing him as his successor. [if the physical contact would not be of significance, why would Moses have bothered? Ed.] The right hand is presumed to be stronger than the left, hence a blessing conveyed by means of the right hand would be a stronger, more comprehensive blessing. ']"
Genesis, 48,21,"['הנה אנכי מת, seeing that I make this my last will and testament when I am close to death, this gift is irrevocable.', 'והשיב אתכם אל ארץ אבותיכם, where my gifts will materialise.']"
Genesis, 48,22,"['ואני נתתי לך, Yaakov emphasises the word אני in order to explain that he was not violating any of the rules pertaining to the distribution of the land of Canaan to the tribes, seeing such a distribution was not yet something at hand, but was still in the realm of the potential. Seeing that he, Yaakov, had personally conquered the city of Shechem, in spite of this city being part of the land of Canaan, seeing that he had taken it from the “Emorite,” i.e. someone whose deeds were as evil as those of the Emorite, (although the inhabitants had been Hittites), what he was allocating to Joseph now was an actual, a gift bestowed by him now, and had no bearing on any distribution of land conquered by Joshua in the future. Yaakov hints that givers who promise a lot wind up actually not even keeping part of their promises, such as Esau. When Yaakov, at the time, had bought the birthright from Esau, Esau forfeited not only his additional share in the land as a firstborn but wound up without any share in the land of Canaan whatsoever.', 'בחרבי ובקשתי, through my intelligence and insight (חכמה ובינה). Whereas the weapons of warriors are the sword and the bow, the equivalent weapons of the righteous, the scholars, are their wisdom and understanding. This is what <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.45.4"" data-ref=""Psalms 45:4"">Psalms 45,4</a> has in mind when the author writes: חגור חרבך על ירך גבור. Our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.63"" data-ref=""Shabbat 63"">Shabbat 63</a> already commented on this verse that the psalmist does not refer to actual weapons but to the use of words of Torah as being the tools used by the Torah scholar. [The interpretation of this verse as something allegorical, and almost diametrically opposed to the plain meaning of the text, is disputed by some scholars in the Talmud there. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 49,1,"['באחרית הימים, at the end of the period allocated to life on earth as we know it. Yaakov speaks of the arrival of the Messiah which will signify the end of the existence of the nations that oppose G’d and the Kingdom of G’d on earth. At that time the measure of sin that these nations accumulate will be full to overflowing, so that G’d will feel at liberty to bring about the appropriate retribution. [the concept is as old as Avraham, to whom G’d explained that realisation of his offspring disinheriting the Canaanites will have to await the time when the measure of sin of these people will be full. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.15.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 15:16"">Genesis 15,16</a>). Ed.] Our author, drawing on various prophecies of the Books of Prophets to support his interpretation of באחרית הימים, “the end of days,” quotes <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.46.28"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 46:28"">Jeremiah 46,28</a>: “for I will make an end to all the nations among which I have banished you; but I will not make an end of you!” He also quotes Bileam’s prophecy in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.24.14"" data-ref=""Numbers 24:14"">Numbers 24,14</a> detailed in verse 17, in which he prophesies the doom befalling all the nations pre-eminent in his time and describes Israel as triumphant at that time. He adds that his prophecy is not one the fulfillment of which is imminent, but that much time will elapse before it will be realised. Similar prophecies are not only found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Micah.4.1"" data-ref=""Micah 4:1"">Michah 4,1</a> but even in our chapter when blessing Yehudah in verse 10, Yaakov speaks of the time frame he has in mind as the one when Shiloh will arrive, the one to whom nations will pay homage.']"
Genesis, 49,2,"['ושמעו אל ישראל אביכם, preserve the teachings Israel taught throughout his life. When you do that you will be entitled to call yourselves בני ישראל, “The Children of Israel.” He, on the other hand, will be proud to call himself “your father.” It means that you as well as I have contended successfully when facing challenges set for you by G’d and by man. As a result, you will not forfeit the good G’d has in store for you.']"
Genesis, 49,3,"['יתר שאת ויתר עז, פחז כמים אל תותר; you are as unstable as water; you will therefore not enjoy an advantage over your brothers, the advantage which would have consisted of יתר שאת, enhanced social position and the entitlement to the firstborn’s extra share in the inheritance as well as the status of priesthood. Even though you are biologically, ראשית אוני, and as such would have been entitled to privileges involving an extra share in my inheritance, (based on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.21.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 21:17"">Deuteronomy 21,17</a>) as well as ', 'יתר עז enhanced political clout by supplying the kings of the Jewish nation from your tribe, you have forfeited all this by having displayed character weakness. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Chronicles.21.3"" data-ref=""II Chronicles 21:3"">Chronicles II 21,3</a> where the claim to the throne by Yehoram was based on his being the firstborn).']"
Genesis, 49,4,"['אז חללת יצועי עלה, at that time you defiled your father’s dignity. Alternatively, Yaakov may have referred to Reuven’s act being a desecration of G’d’s honour. As an appropriate punishment, Reuven’s own status, which had been one of special honour, would be diminished accordingly.']"
Genesis, 49,5,"['<b>Brothers.</b> Because of your brotherhood you should have received the kingship after Reuvein lost it, but a king, who is charged with establishing justice, cannot be a violent person.', 'כלי חמס מכרותיהם, people who make use of weaponry in their day to day activities are not suitable material for wielding political and military power. Hence neither one of them will be accorded the status taken away from Reuven. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.29.4"" data-ref=""Proverbs 29:4"">Proverbs 29,4</a> where Solomon describes a king’s primary characteristic as being במשפט יעמד ארץ, “seeing to it that the rule of law and justice prevails on earth.”) Shimon and Levi had disqualified themselves from claiming such a distinction.']"
Genesis, 49,7,"['ארור אפם, may their level of anger be reduced, restricted. Yaakov wanted to achieve this by making it harder for them to earn their livelihood, so that they would be fully occupied doing that and caring for their families. They would have to spend their energies by traveling far and wide to secure their livelihood. However, the status of priesthood would remain the domain of the firstborn as it had been before Reuven became guilty of his indiscretion. This status was changed only after the sin of the golden calf when it was transferred en masse to the Levites (some of them). Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.10.8"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 10:8"">Deuteronomy 10 8</a>, בעת ההיא וגו\'.']"
Genesis, 49,8,"['יהודה אתה, “you are the one who is fit to fill the position of royalty. The reason is that you are not stained with fatal flaws which would disqualify you from becoming king.', 'יודוך אחיך, your brothers will accept you as king as they admit that you are fit to rule.', 'ידך בעורף אויביך, so that they will flee from you so that you do not destroy them. We find a similar construction in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.27"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:27"">Exodus 23,27</a> ונתתי את כל אויביך אליך עורף, “I will make all your enemies turn their backs on you.”', 'וישתחוו לך בני אביך; you will rule over all your brothers (fellow tribes), but not over all the other nations,']"
Genesis, 49,9,"['גור אריה יהודה, although Yehudah is not a fully grown lion, i.e. not enjoying the trappings of royalty, possessing a land, etc, he is at least comparable to a lion cub, preeminent among his brothers. In the future he will rule as king in the full meaning of the word. All this, in spite of the fact that', 'מטרף בני עלית, you were spared by my son Joseph who did not kill you in his wrath although he hated you. This is the meaning of the words כרע רבץ כאריה, seeing that at that time he was like a crouching lion, one in repose, i.e. not representing a threat to anyone This is why Joseph did not issue you orders to kill you.', 'וכלביא מי יקימנו, once Yehudah will attain the position of king, he will be like such a lion who on occasion will lie down languidly just like a lion, a time when no one can frighten him into rising because he has become afraid of the enemy.']"
Genesis, 49,10,"['לא יסור שבט מיהודה, once he will have attained the formal position of king, as hinted at by the wordsוכלביא מי יקימנו in the previous verse, the scepter symbolising his rule will not move to any other tribal leader, unlike that of King Sha-ul, who, although crowned with G’d’s approval, was deprived of founding a dynasty by G’d Who had rejected him on account of his disobedience (a promise by the prophet Nathan to David who had also sinned, compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.7.15"" data-ref=""II Samuel 7:15"">Samuel II 7,15</a>). When the kingdom of Yehudah headed by a monarch of Davidic origin did collapse and was destroyed by the Babylonians, this did not contradict what Yaakov had predicted here that the scepter would not pass to others from the tribe of Yehudah. Yaakov spoke only about a period during which the state and the kingdom would continue to exist, prophesying that as long as that condition existed the rule would not be transferred to anyone belonging to another tribe. He had not addressed the possibility of Jewish statehood being lost altogether.', 'ומחוקק מבין רגליו, that his descendants would sit on the throne as judges, and that other members of his tribe would be among those who would be scribes for the judges as was the custom.', 'עד כי יבא שילה, the word שילה is a composite of the root שול meaning שולים, boundaries, margins. The other part of the word is based on the root שלה, the root of the word שלום. Shalom, commonly understood as “peace,” means “the end of the road,” after whatever wrangling in order to achieve an objective has been successfully concluded. Yaakov is saying that until the advent of שילה, i.e. the second part of that word, Yehudah’s pre-eminence will be marginal, narrowly bounded. Once the Messiah will arrive, however, ', 'ולו יקהת עמים, nations will subordinate themselves to him displaying their weakness. The meaning of the word קהה as weakness is supported by <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.10.10"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 10:10"">Kohelet 10,10</a> אם קהה הברזל, “if the axe is blunt, etc.” A blunt blade is a weak blade. The survivors of the wars preceding the arrival of the Messiah will have been weakened sufficiently, heeding the instructions of the Messiah as predicted by Bileam in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.24.17"" data-ref=""Numbers 24:17"">Numbers 24,17</a>.']"
Genesis, 49,11,"['אוסרי לגפן עירה, this is one of the things that help us recognise the Redeemer when he comes. 1) he will manifest himself as Messiah by a foal borne by a she-ass. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zechariah.9.9"" data-ref=""Zechariah 9:9"">Zecharyah 9,9</a>) The reason this indicates that he is the Messiah is that he does not arrive on a horse, an animal which is ready for battle, for war. The final battle involving the nations of the world will already have been fought and won by G’d at the time he will manifest himself. He will commence his reign when peace already prevails. 2) the fact that he will tie his ass to a גפן, a vine, will be a symbol that he is destined to rule over the Jewish people, the people who have been compared to a grape vine as stated in Chulin 92. The prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.5.7"" data-ref=""Isaiah 5:7"">Isaiah 5,7</a> also referred to the Jewish people as G’d’s vineyard.', 'ולשרקה בני אתונו, this is a reference to a third symbol by which the Messiah will be identified, that not only will he tie his ass to a vine but to a sorekah, a choice vine. The wine from such vine illuminates the eyes of the Just of their respective generations, something that cannot be said of an ordinary vine.', 'כבס ביין לבושו, the fourth sign identifying the Messiah is that he will be able to launder his garments in blood. He will have to do this as he will find many people who have been slain in the war preceding his coming, and he will assist in their burial. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.63.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 63:2"">Isaiah 63,2</a> מדוע אדום ללבושך “why are your garments so red?”) Another allusion to this is found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.110.6"" data-ref=""Psalms 110:6"">Psalms 110,6</a> ידין בגויים מלא גווית, “he works judgment on the nations piling up bodies.”']"

Genesis, 49,13,"['<b>Zevulun will settle.</b> See Rashi. Zevulun’s blessing precedes that of Yissachar both here and <i>Devarim</i> (33:18) because Torah study is impossible unless someone provides the scholars with their basic needs. For the same reason the study is accredited to scholar and supporter alike.', 'והוא לחוף אניות, he will travel beyond the borders of his own land with ships carrying and bringing all kinds of wares. Part of these rare wares are the chalazon, the worm needed to provide the blue colour for the tzitzit, fragrances needed for the daily incense offerings.

Ed.] The unique nature of this kind of stove is that the pots are not capable of being moved or removed from it until the cooking or boiling is complete and the fire has gone out. Yaakov describes a simile in which Issachar, i.e. the donkey can hold out until he has completed the job assigned to him. The whole verse is a parable symbolising how Issachar accepts the yoke of the Torah and studies Torah with all the energy at his command. He does this in addition to shouldering the burden of derech eretz, i.e. doing justice to the more mundane demands made upon everybody living on this planet.']"
Genesis, 49,15,"['וירא מנוחה כי טוב, by pursuing his twin objectives he found true מנוחה, i.e. a kind of being at peace with oneself knowing one has done what is expected of one.

This reflects what our sages have said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Moed_Katan.6"" data-ref=""Moed Katan 6"">Moed Katan 6</a> that young Torah scholars have to accept the burdens of their entire town upon themselves.', 'ויהי למס עובד, the general population which carries out the day-to-day mundane tasks involved in a civilised existence will be at the disposal of Issachar who is busy with Torah study instead. The word מס refers to the ordinary working man doing the chores of Issachar being viewed as the tax being paid on behalf of Issachar, seeing that he himself cannot be taxed on non-earned income. In halachah, (Yumah 72) this is described as the ordinary citizen having to perform public service duties from which the Torah scholars are excused.']"
Genesis, 49,17,"['יהי דן נחש, a reference to a poisonous snake, one commonly called tzifoni, in Biblical literature. Arab physicians usually call such venomous snakes chorman. The name for such snakes implies that a single snake can kill numerous people at once, using both its stare, and it voice (hiss) which is heard and seen by many people. It is a fitting comparison to Shimshon who, all on his own, killed many people almost simultaneously.', 'שפיפון, name of a slim snake; our sages use this when wanting to illustrate something extremely thin, “as the width of a hair.” Physicians claim that these types of snakes hide in the trees, their sting being felt as if one had been shot by an arrow. Shimshon’s mode of operation, an individual lying in wait, in ambush, is compared by Yaakov to this snake.']"
Genesis, 49,19,"['גד גדוד יגודנו, after having said that Dan fights like a snake felling horse and rider, Yaakov now contrasts Gad’s mode of operation with that of Dan by saying that the Gadites act in groups. Moses also repeats this theme in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.33.20"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 33:20"">Deut. 33,20</a> when he said וטרף זרועו קדקוד, “he tore off arm and scalp.”', 'והוא יגוד עקב, when he fells horse and rider he will cut off their heels..

Genesis, 49,22,"['בן פורת יוסף, Joseph is considered the product of a proliferating grapevine. It spreads its protective shade for the benefit of many. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.80.11"" data-ref=""Psalms 80:11"">Psalms 80,11</a> we are told of this function of the grapevine in the words כסו הרים צלה, “the mountains were covered by its shade.” The simile means that Yaakov and his family lived under the protective cover of Joseph, i.e. in his shade. ', 'The word פורת derivative of פוריה, fruitful, implies the proximity of a spring, a well of water. בנות, branches. The grapevine brings forth many branches.', 'צעדה עלי שור, describing how these branches even grow beyond the wall surrounding the orchard. Alternatively, what is meant is that the branches extend beyond the fence surrounding the well. Prior to its prolific growth it could not be seen from the far side of the wall. People living on that side of the wall did not even have an idea that something was growing there. Once the branches had topped the wall, its presence suddenly became noticeable and provoked reactions on the other side. The other side of the parable, are, of course, Yaakov on the one hand, and Joseph and his sons, who had developed in Egypt without their father even being aware that they were alive. Suddenly, what had been hidden from him for 22 years had become revealed. This is what he meant when he said on meeting him: ראה פניך לא פללתי והנה הראה אותי אלוקים גם את זרעך, I did not even expect ever to see your face again, and now G’d has shown me not only you but also your offspring. (48,11)']"
Genesis, 49,23,"['49,23. וישטמוהו בעלי חצים, The expression בעלי חצים means: “the slanderers.” The word חץ, usually meaning “arrow,” is used as a simile for slander in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.9"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 9"">Jeremiah 9</a>,7חץ שחוט לשונם, “their tongues are like a sharp arrow.” One of these slanderers was the chief of the cup bearers when he referred to Joseph as נער עברי עבד, three words which are each a derogatory term. (41,12). Also some of Pharaoh’s servants are included in the list of those who slandered Joseph. They are reported as commenting with disdain that “Pharaoh has appointed a slave who had been sold for 20 pieces of silver as our ruler.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.36"" data-ref=""Sotah 36"">Sotah 36</a>).']"
Genesis, 49,24,"['ותשב באיתן קשתו. The reply to such accusations was given by Pharaoh himself when he challenged his servants with the words: “where else can we find such an individual endowed with the spirit of G’d?” (41,39) As a result, Joseph did not have to use his own ammunition. In other words, he could keep his arrows in his quiver, unused.', 'ויפוזו זרעי ידיו, his arms were immeasurably strengthened when Pharaoh transferred his ring with the Royal seal to him.', 'מידי אביר יעקב, however, the real salvation emanated from the G’d Who had proven Himself by doing the same for Yaakov. It is He Who enables Yaakov’s descendants to survive among the hostile nations, so that in the end only they will survive. The very name “Yaakov” suggests that in the end there will be only he. In the meantime, He is the One Who kept you alive and saved you from the slanderers who took aim at you.', 'משם, from then on the', 'רועה אבן ישראל, He will continue to act as the Shepherd of Israel preserving His people who will endure like אבן, a stone. It does not matter whether this stone is intrinsically precious or not, being a “stone” it will endure.

The stone in the dream represented Israel, the image, the nations of the world.

Genesis, 49,25,"['מאל אביך, all of this (assistance) originated from the G’d of your father who had told me that the ascendancy of the Jewish people would manifest itself only after a period of mental suffering and physical debasement. This is what is meant when G’d said to Yaakov in 28,14 והיה זרעך כעפר הארץ, “your seed will be like the dust of the earth,” before he went on to say ופרצת ימה וקדמה, “you will spread out in all directions of the globe.”', 'ויעזרך, so that you will not again descend to the depths.', 'ואת שדי, same as if the Torah had written ומאת א-ל שדי, “from the G’d whose attribute is Shaddai.” Yaakov mentions this attribute specifically as it had been this attribute of G’d which had appeared to him in 35,11 promising that he would develop into a community of nations. Joseph’s greatness would be orchestrated with the help of this attribute of G’d.', 'ויברכך, He, Himself, without intermediary. This would be different from the blessing extended to Ephrayim and Menashe in which Yaakov promised that “the angel,” i.e. the intermediary, who has looked after me would look after these children of Joseph. (48,16). This blessing was also different in character from the blessings of Yitzchok for Esau, and that from Moses for the people crossing into the Holy Land. In all those instances, except in the blessing Moses referred to in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.1.11"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 1:11"">Deuteronomy 1,11</a> which was given by him prior to the sin of the spies, the initiators of the blessing were human beings, i.e. Yitzckok or Moses. G’d would be asked to honour promises made by humans as a blessing. In our situation here, Yaakov commands the blessing to originate with the attribute of G’d known as Shaddai.', 'ברכות שמים מעל, in the sense that the days of your life would be completed as planned before you were born. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.27"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:27"">Exodus 23,27</a>)', 'ברכות תהום רובצת תחת, material blessings, adequate food and money to buy necessities.', 'ברכות שדים ורחם. This is a blessing concerning having healthy and numerous children, in contrast with the expression רחם משכיל ושדים צומקים, “a womb that miscarries and shriveled breasts” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Hosea.9.14"" data-ref=""Hosea 9:14"">Hosea 9,14</a>)']"
Genesis, 49,26,"['ברכות אביך, may He also grant you the blessing which has been bestowed on your father when the same G’d promised me that I would spread out in all directions of the globe.

This was only an extension of the original blessing given to Avraham at the beginning of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.12"" data-ref=""Genesis 12"">Genesis 12</a> that ונברכו בך כל משפחות האדמה ובזרעך, “through you will be blessed all the families of the earth and through your descendants.” This verse is also a promise to the moral elite of the gentiles who in the words of Bileam in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.23.23"" data-ref=""Numbers 23:23"">Numbers 23,23</a> will be numbered among the people loyal to G’d and who will receive their reward.

[If I understand the author correctly, he feels that unless the promise given to Avraham at the beginning of Lech Lecha will help those חסידי אומות העולם, the righteous among the gentiles who are deserving, to survive the cataclysmic events preceding the coming of the Messiah, they are of too transient a nature to be taken seriously. Ed.] The distinction of the Jewish people lies in the fact that they do not turn to soothsayers, and all kinds of charlatans, astrologers or palm readers to divine the future. If they want to know something about the future they turn to G’d directly or to a prophet, or they are content to let G’d do what He considers to be right. Hence, by proclaiming the name of the Lord one is presumed to belong to this elite. Verses quoted by the author, such as <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.61.6"" data-ref=""Isaiah 61:6"">Isaiah 61,6</a> as well as <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zechariah.8.23"" data-ref=""Zechariah 8:23"">Zecharyah 8,23</a> are an assurance that when the time comes, having been steadfast in one’s loyalty to G’d, one will share in the ultimate salvation. The Jews at that time will finally be recognised as deserving a position of leadership amongst mankind.', 'גברו על ברכות הורי, and the reason that I said ברכות אביך is because they are more powerful than the ones which my parents, הורי, received.', 'עד תאות גבעות עולם for my blessings extend to the end of the globe, both extremes of the sun’s orbit which spans the continents. They are so called as they represent the end of “time”. etc. [there is no point in completing the author’s words as the astronomy since Copernicus is viewed completely differently than during the author’s time, Ed.]', 'תהיינה לראש יוסף, these words are understood as emanating from G’d Who will send His blessings onto the head of Joseph directly, without the services of any intermediary. Moses parallels Yaakov’s syntax when he said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.33.16"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 33:16"">Deuteronomy 33,16</a> in his blessing to Joseph תאנה לראש יוסף, ורצון שכני סנה.

He had proved by his very actions that he was worthy of such distinction, so that he is the recipient of direct blessings from G’d. Also Joseph’s descendants remained on a moral level close to that of his illustrious ancestor, so that the first of the Judges, Moses’ successor, was the leader of the people, being in effect the “king” of his nation. Compare Hoseah 13,1 כדבר אפרים אתת נשא בישראל, “when Ephrayim spoke piety he was exalted in Israel.” [a reference to Joshua’s contradicting the spies’ majority report. Ed.]']"
Genesis, 49,27,"['זאב יטרוף, it is the custom of wolves to attack either early in the morning or in the evening, both periods when there is not much light. We find support for this in Chabakuk 1,8. Binyamin’s rise to power also occurred at the dawn of Jewish monarchies in the person of King Sha-ul, and once more near the end of Jewish one man rule under Mordechai. Subsequently, there was never again a true Jewish political independence, and the religious leadership was in the hands of the אנשי כנסת הגדולה, a college of 120 elders.']"

They are also the ones who were mentioned as such at the covenant on Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyval. The twelve stones which Moses erected also symbolised these twelve tribes. Again. Joshua erected 12 stones at the Jordan as well as at Gilgal, and Elijah erected 12 stones at the altar. In none of these instances are Ephrayim and Menashe treated as separate tribes. They only figured as separate tribes when it came to the land distribution, seeing that the tribe of Levi did not share in that.', 'ויברך אותם, in addition to blessings bestowed individually rather than collectively, earlier.', 'איש אשר כברכתו ברך אותם, he gave an individual blessing to each one in accordance with what he perceived to be the son’s need in view of his eventual destiny.

Exodus, 2,23,"['בימים הרבים ההם, from the day Moses had fled from Egypt in his youth until Gershom had been born when he was close to 80 years of age. We are assuming that Eliezer was not much younger, and we know that he was only born when Moses was already on his way back to Egypt. We know that that Moses was 80 years of age t that time.', 'וימת מלך מצרים, the same Pharaoh who had been pursuing Moses wanting to execute him. This is why he called his second son Eliezer, as then he realised that he had finally been saved by G’d from the sword of Pharaoh.', 'ויזעקו, they cried out of frustration about their miserable fate and their enslavement. A similar expression for venting such feelings of frustration occurs in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.14"" data-ref=""Isaiah 14"">Isaiah 14</a>,31הלילי שער זעקי העיר, “Howl, o gate! Cry out, o city!”', 'ותעל שועתם אל האלוקים מן העובדה. G’d’s response was not due to their repenting and praying, but He simply was angry over the excessive cruelty with which the Egyptians treated the Jewish people This is why He added (when He spoke to Moses in 3,9) וגם ראיתי את הלחץ אשר מצרים לוחצים אותם, “and I have also seen the pressure that the Egyptians keep imposing on them. [perhaps the reason why our author does not consider the Jews’ repentance and prayer being a factor is the fact that the attribute with which G’d responded was still the attribute of Justice, אלוקים and not the attribute Hashem as he explained to Moses in 3,9 Ed.]']"
Exodus, 2,24,"['וישמע אלוקים את נאקתם, a reference to the prayer of a few of them, [as Moses recalls in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.20.16"" data-ref=""Numbers 20:16"">Numbers 20,16</a> ונצעק אל ה\', i.e. the prayer by the righteous few. Seeing that Moses speaks in the plural and he had not been in Egypt at the time, he must have paraphrased why the few righteous people of the time had done at the time before G’d’s response came.

And I remembered My covenant.”']"
Exodus, 2,25,"['וירא אלוקים את בני ישראל, He now took a personal interest in their fate and no longer hid His countenance from them. This is perceived as similar to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.9.16"" data-ref=""I Samuel 9:16"">Samuel I 9,16</a>: כי ראיתי את עמי, כי באה צעקתו אלי, “for I have seen My people, for its outcry has come to Me.” G’d Himself said this later in 3,7 ראה ראיתי את עני אשר במצרים, “for I have seen My people, the suffering they are in Egypt.”', 'וידע אלוקים, and that the prayer and outcry were totally genuine. This is why He Himself speaks later of כי ידעתיו את מכאוביו “for I am aware of its pains.” This was in contrast with <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.78.36-37"" data-ref=""Psalms 78:36-37"">Psalms 78,36-37</a> where the Jewish people were described as paying only lip-service to their G’d and continued to be disloyal to heir covenant with G’d.']"
Exodus, 3,1,"['ויבא אל הר האלוקים חורבה. Moses, all by himself; he wanted to pray and meditate there in complete isolation and concentration. The phrase is similar to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.13.22"" data-ref=""Numbers 13:22"">Numbers 13,22</a> ויבא עד חברון, where we find that one of the spies, Calev, reportedly, came to Chevron. [the sudden singular ויבא instead of ויבואו, there prompted the sages to say that Calev went to pray at the graves of the patriarchs. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 3,2,"['וירא מלאך ה\' אליו, in a prophetic vision. When angels  appear to humans in human garb this is not considered a prophetic vision, i.e. it is something of a lower order of Divine manifestation. Divine communications to Avraham, Lot, Bileam, and others like them are not described as וירא, vayeyrah, “it appeared.” However, the recipient is described as וירא, “he saw,” i.e. he is described only in his active role, not his role as receptacle of G’d’s communication. Examples of the latter kind of communication occur in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.18.2"" data-ref=""Genesis 18:2"">Genesis 18,2</a> as well as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.19.1"" data-ref=""Genesis 19:1"">Genesis 19,1</a> and in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.22.31"" data-ref=""Numbers 22:31"">Numbers 22,31</a>.', 'וירא והנה הסנה בוער באש, it kept burning; This phenomenon indicated the prophetic nature of the experience. Unless the angel had been within the bush, this could not have happened as something natural. The fire Moses saw burning enveloped the angel. The implied message was that the righteous members of the Jewish people, who are themselves angels of G’d, i.e. His messengers on earth, and who are surrounded by the Egyptian nation who treated them as burning thistles or less, would themselves become subject to this fire when enduring the ten plagues, but would remain unharmed by all those plagues. This is what Moses was taught when he saw והסנה איננו אוכל. it was not consumed by the flames which kept burning. The level of Moses’ prophecy at that time was not yet at the level it would be later on. The very fact that the Torah describes Moses as being even afraid to look at the spectacle before his eyes is proof of this (compare verse 6). From the day the Torah was given, as the Torah testifies in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.12.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 12:8"">Numbers 12,8</a> ותמונת ה\' יביט, G’d extended the power of Moses’ prophetic visions so that He shows him a visual image of G’d. The entire Jewish people had had a brief revelation of G’d’s glory at Mont Sinai only. Their power of endurance was so limited even at that time that the Torah reports them as saying that they could not even endure hearing the voice of the Lord, not to speak of enduring a visual image. Only Moses was able to retain the level of prophecy which the entire nation experienced during the revelation at Mount Sinai. This is the meaning of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.27-28"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:27-28"">Deuteronomy 5,27-28</a> שובו לכם לאהליכם ואתה פה עמוד עמדי, “you (pl.) go back to your tents, and you (sing.) remain standing here beside Me.” This is also borne out by <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.18"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:18"">Exodus 20,18</a> ויעמוד העם מרחוק, “the people stood at a distance,” followed by ומשה נגש, “whereas Moses approached.” (to the cloud within which the glory of G’d was enveloped). Moses’ level of prophecy from that time on remained on the level known as פנים אל פנים, “face to face,” i.e. direct, not indirect.  G’d told Miriam and Aaron there that He does not speak to Moses in riddles but by showing him a visual image (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.12.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 12:8"">Numbers 12,8</a>)']"
Exodus, 3,3,"['אסורה נא ואראה; I will try and understand the phenomenon by looking at it more closely. מדוע לא יבער הסנה. Why the Egyptians do not perish from the many plagues they have to endure. The normal reaction to burning is that the object afire is consumed by the fire, as mentioned in Ovadiah 18.\n']"
Exodus, 3,4,"[""וירא ה' כי סר לראות, When G’d saw that Moses took a deeper interest in the phenomenon,"", 'ויקרא אליו אלוקים, to explain the phenomenon to him, in accordance with the well known principle ofהבא לטהר מסיין אותו, “when someone wants to purify something impure one extends a helping hand to him “ A well known example of this is <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.19.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 19:3"">Exodus 19,3</a> where we find that as soon as Moses ascended the mountain G’d descended toward him.\n']"
Exodus, 3,5,"['של נעליך, even on the spot you are standing on now.']"
Exodus, 3,7,"[' ראה ראיתי את עני עמי, “I have indeed seen the plight of My people.” A reference to the righteous ones among them who groaned and sighed over the sins of their generation and their resulting plight, praying. In response to the prayer of these righteous people the angel answered out of the burning bush. The meaning of the words ראה ראיתי is “indeed I have seen, taken notice.” This construction is normal wherever the Torah employs a dual, duplicate construction.  The reason for the duplication is as if to contradict someone who denies that G’d has seen what goes on. It is as if saying: ‘in spite of anything you think or say, I insist that you are wrong and I am right.” It is similar to Yaakov negating Joseph’s trying go correct the position of his hands when he was blessing Ephrayim and Menashe. At that time Yaakov simply said: “I know my son, I know.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.48.19"" data-ref=""Genesis 48:19"">Genesis 48,19</a>) The angel confirmed to Moses that in spite of G’d being aware of the Israelite’s problems and the fact that He was going to inflict numerous plagues on the Egyptians, the latter would not simply collapse in spite of all the plagues. My intention with the plagues is not to destroy the Egyptians and to leave the Israelites in their place, on their land, but I want to save the Israelites and to take them out of Egypt in order to settle them elsewhere.']"
Exodus, 3,8,"['וארד להצילו...ולהעלותו מן הארץ ההיא אל ארץ, I revealed Myself to you in this manifestation only to acquaint you with the fact that I will save the Israelite nation and lead them out of Egypt, not in order to destroy Egypt.', 'זבת חלב ודבש, a land with much livestock and abundant food of good quality and of nourishing properties (honey). These terms are used in this sense in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.24.13"" data-ref=""Proverbs 24:13"">Proverbs 24,13</a> אכול בני דבש כי טוב ונפת מתוק. “My son, eat honey for it is good, and the honeycomb for it is sweet on your palate.”']"
Exodus, 3,9,"['ועתה, seeing that all this is true. This is the meaning of the word ועתה wherever it appears. G’d said: in view of the fact that the Israelites’ complaints are justified, that they are entitled to complain, and I am aware of their pain, etc.,', 'הנה צעקת בני ישראל  באה אלי, I have accepted their prayer after they truly called on Me, [aware that I could help them. Ed.] They did not merely mouth these prayers to give themselves the illusion of having vented their frustrations (compare Psalms 27,36).', 'וגם ראיתי את הלחץ, in view of the excessive pressure brought to bear on them, the ones applying the pressure deserve to be punished. We find a similar construction in Zecharyah 1,15:וקצף גדול אני קוצף על הגוים השאננים אשר אני קצפתי מעט והם עזרו לרעה, “and I am very angry with those nations that are at ease; for I was only angry a little; but they overdid the punishment.”\n']"
Exodus, 3,10,"['ועתה לכה ואשלחך, to them, to warn them before I have to resort to punishing them.']"
Exodus, 3,11,"['מי אנכי כי אלך?,  how will my warning be effective?', 'וכי אוציא את בני ישראל, that I will have the merit to take out the Jewish people who are at this time not deserving of this?']"
Exodus, 3,12,"['כי אהיה עמך וזה לך האות, that you will not only issue decrees but will carry them out successfully wherever you turn. Your very success will convince everyone that I must be the One who has sent you. They will therefore take you and your words very seriously. We find that this did indeed come true in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.11.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 11:3"">Exodus 11,3</a> והאיש משה גדול מאד בכל ארץ מצרים, “the man Moses was very great in the whole land of Egypt.”', 'בהוציאך את העם ממצרים תעבדון את האלוקים על ההר הזה.. even though they are not worthy of redemption at this time, but they are worthy of serving the Lord at this mountain when you take them out from among these professional sinners.

Exodus, 3,13,"['""ואמרו לי ""מה שמו?, a name describes the individual features of a person, Being, or what makes him distinctive. The people could therefore be expected to ask Moses in what manner this G’d whose messenger he claimed to be had distinguished Himself as being special, different from other gods.']"
Exodus, 3,14,"['אהיה אשר אהיה. I am an independent existence, not subject to influences by other phenomena or even caused by them. Seeing that this is so it follows that I love existing, and beings that exist. As a corollary to this love of Mine for existence, it follows that I deeply resent anything or anyone who tries to terminate such an existing being from continuing to do so. The prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.18.32"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 18:32"">Ezekiel 18,32</a> phrased this thought as “for I do not desire the death of him that dies.” From this it follows that I must love righteousness and justice the objective of both virtues being the continued existence of all who deserve it. At the same time, it follows that I must hate injustice and cruelty as these vices are apt to terminate the existence of the victims of these vices. Clearly, then, this G’d must hate the violence and cruelty perpetrated on you by the Egyptians.']"
Exodus, 3,15,"['ויאמר עוד אלוקים אל משה כה תאמר אל בני ישראל, the Beney Yisrael that G’d refers to here are the elders of the people. (according to Rashi the people at large would not understand such thoughts.)', ""ה' אלוקיכם, this is also the G’d of your patriarchs in addition to being the G’d possessing these virtues just mentioned. He had concluded a covenant with your patriarchs including all their offspring, so that this is part of My definition (name) זה שמי לעולם, forever as well as the name He already was known by previously before this additional attribute through the covenant with the patriarchs."", 'זכרי לדור ודור, this is what wise men have figured out for themselves already since time immemorial that there must be a prime Cause, an eternal Being, not subject to change, i.e, to aging,  weakening.

Exodus, 3,19,"['כי לא יתן אתכם מלך מצרים להלוך. He will not agree to do this from his own free volition at My request.', 'ולא ביד חזקה, I will see to it that he will not even allow you to depart as a result of the plagues I shall inflict on Egypt. I will arrange that as soon as a plague has ceased he will change his mind in order to give Me a chance to inflict further plagues on him as chastisement. ']"
Exodus, 3,20,"['והכיתי את מצרים בכל נפלאותי, in a manner which will make everyone who hears about these plagues sit up and take notice. Many of those who will hear about this will perhaps repent and abandon idolatry. [the author does not view the plagues as a punishment but as G’d’s educational tool. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 3,22,"['ונצלתם את מצרים. Even though all that they will give you will be on loan and you will be obligated to return these items. The status of these “borrowed” articles underwent a legal change when these same Egyptians turned into pursuers of the departing Israelites with intent to kill them. From that moment on what had previously been on loan now became legitimate booty of war. Not only that, but the previous owners had died in a war fought against them by G’d Himself when the pursuers had become the pursued, something which happens in many wars.']"
Exodus, 4,1,"[""והן לא יאמינו לי ולא ישמעו בקולי, once the people will see that Pharaoh will refuse to let them go, they will lose faith in me and will not listen to my promises.

Exodus, 4,2,"['מה זה בידך?, here is a staff which is an inert object, and the hand which is something very much alive. I will demonstrate that I can kill that which is alive and bring to life that which is dead. I will make your hand useless and your staff will suddenly come alive.']"
Exodus, 4,3,"['וינס משה מפניו, for the staff had become a real snake and had assumed a threatening posture. This was totally different from the “snakes” produced by Pharaoh’s magicians that were unable to move. They only looked like the real thing, but were totally harmless.

Our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.67"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 67"">Sanhedrin 67</a> commented on this phenomenon by saying: “not only can the sorcerers not produce small creatures, they cannot even produce big creatures such as a camel” This is why in the case of Moses, the Torah speaks of “the staff which had turned into a נחש, serpent,” whereas when the sorcerers’ work is described the Torah speaks of תנין. [at that point Aaron’s staff also turned into a תנין, not נחש, as G’d was not yet ready to demonstrate the superior magic Moses was capable of. Only when Aaron’s staff swallowed the “taninim” of the sorcerers was that point brought home to Pharaoh.]']"
Exodus, 4,8,"['והאמינו לקול האות האחרון, from a medical science point of view the ability to heal tzoraat was a far greater miracle as it meant bringing back to life a limb which had already died ולקחת ממימי היאור, seeing that water is a basic liquid, one of the four basic raw materials earth is constructed of, converting this into blood without adding any additional ingredient to it was a most remarkable miracle.

G’d says: “I will command you from time to time to enter the capital in order to speak to Pharaoh.” ', 'ראה כל המופתים אשר שמתי בידך, pay careful attention each time you go to Pharaoh when you will be equipped with the power to perform all the miracles which I have placed at your disposal. You must perform these in exactly the manner I have instructed you.', 'ועשיתם לפני פרעה,  you will be successful in this only if you proceed exactly in the manner in which I instruct you, and in the presence of Pharaoh. When a creature sins against his Creator by doing either less or more than instructed to do, he will fail in what he set out to do. This rule did not only apply to Moses and Aaron when they set out to perform miracles, but it is a general rule applicable to all of G’d’s commandments, and this is why the Torah spelled this out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.4.2"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 4:2"">Deuteronomy 4,2</a> writing “do not add or subtract from all the commandments which I have commanded you.”', 'ואני אחזק את לבו, for if he could not endure the plagues he would let the Israelites go, not because he was finally humbling himself before the Lord and do His will, but only in order to get relief from the plagues.

In effect what G’d is saying is that He has not made a point of becoming familiar to the patriarchs by His attribute Hashem when appearing to them, such as in the example mentioned. This was because He never experienced the need to change the laws of nature on their behalf. Seeing that the patriarchs could not have passed on knowledge about Me which I had not revealed to them, they in turn had not been able to pass on such knowledge to their children. I have to do this now in order to ensure that I can  preserve the Children of Israel as My people.""]"

This is where they were different from Avraham in his time, who believed implicitly in an impossible-sounding promise, and who gave credit to G’d for making such a promise. This was eventually the reason why this part of G’d’s promise was not fulfilled in the lifetime of the people who were being addressed at this time.', 'מקצר רוח, for it did not appear believable to their present state of mind, so that their heart could not assimilate such a promise.', 'ומעבודה קשה, if it had not been for the heavy labour which they had to perform they would have paid much more attention to Moses’ words, and they would have understood that Moses’ arguments made what he said very believable.\n']"
Exodus, 6,12,"['הן בני ישראל לא שמעו אלי, he believed that this was due to the fact that from the moment he had started speaking to Pharaoh the latter had become worse in his attitude and the people, putting two and two together, had concluded that his mission had failed. If he felt that way, Pharaoh would certainly not pay any heed to him and continue doing what he liked. ', 'This was especially so, seeing that he was also an ערל שפתים, afflicted with a speech handicap. He mentioned this as he did not believe that Aaron would accompany him other than for the time he identified himself as G’d’s emissary when he spoke to the people.']"
Exodus, 6,13,"['ויצום, He appointed them as ministers. We find something parallel in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.27.23"" data-ref=""Numbers 27:23"">Numbers 27,23</a> when ויצוהו means that Moses appointed Joshua as his successor with the same authority as he had possessed during the previous 40 years.

Concerning this topic both Pharaoh and the people of Israel were placed under the direction of Moses and Aaron.']"
Exodus, 6,14,"['אלה ראשי בית אבותם, Moses and Aaron were justifiably referred to as the heads of the various tribal groups of Israel, as they were the most respected and most honoured. ראובן בכור ישראל, seeing that none of his descendants were particularly noteworthy except his sons who had been part of the original 70 persons who had come to the land of Egypt from Canaan, none other are mentioned. All those 70 persons had already died as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.1.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 1:6"">Exodus 1,6</a>. The same consideration held true for the descendants of Shimon. On the other hand, Levi, the longest surviving member of the original 70 Hebrews who migrated to Egypt, managed to raise even his grandchildren to become leaders of the people in their own right. Amram produced three outstanding children in the persons of Aaron, Moses and Miriam, all of whom attained prophetic stature. Aaron married a sister of Nachshon who had been considered the most notable member of the nation in his time. He begat leaders of the generation who were later on appointed as priests. Eleazar, son of Aaron took as a wife one of the daughters of Putiel who was also considered outstanding in his generation (compare Nachmanides). This union produced Pinchas who was granted a covenant of “peace” by G’d as a reward for spontaneously slaying a high ranking Israelite prince who flagrantly engaged in forbidden sex with a Midianite princess and had challenged Moses to do something about it. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.25.12"" data-ref=""Numbers 25:12"">Numbers 25,12</a>) אלה ראשי אבות הלוים, just to tell us that Moses and Aaron were the respective heads of the Levites.\n']"
Exodus, 6,25,"['אלה ראשי אבות, just to tell us that Moses and Aaron were the respective heads of the Levites.']"
Exodus, 6,26,"['הוא אהרן ומשה, repeated, seeing these two were the most honoured of their families and it was therefore they who were fit to be entrusted by G’d with the command: הוציאו את בני ישראל, seeing that their voices would be heeded by their compatriots, of all the various tribes.', 'על צבאותם, the entire community including all their respective members, simultaneously.']"
Exodus, 6,27,"['הם המדברים, they were fit to be the spokesmen to Pharaoh and to be listened to by him with respect.']"
Exodus, 6,28,"[""ויהי ביום דבר ה' אל משה, when G’d spoke to Moses  that he should speak to Pharaoh and he answered G’d that Pharaoh would not listen to him, i.e. after G’d had already appointed Moses and Aaron as the leading authorities over Israel as well as over Pharaoh, as reported, G’d explained that He had not intended to give both Moses and Aaron equal status, but that Moses would be an authority, G’d like, for Pharaoh, whereas Aaron would be his mouthpiece, his interpreter.""]"
Exodus, 7,3,"['ואני אקשה, seeing that G’d is interested in the sinner’s repentance rather than his death (as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.33.11"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 33:11"">Ezekiel 33,11</a> חי אני, נאום ה\', אם אחפוץ במות הרשע כי אם בשובו מדרכו וחיה, “by My life, I do not want the death of the wicked but that he return from his wicked path and live”), G’d told Moses that He would bring on numerous plagues, all in order to increase the chances that Pharaoh would finally see the light and become a genuine penitent. He hoped that by demonstrating His greatness and His power this would eventually cause the Egyptians to recognise all this. At the same time, G’d also spelled out a similar thought in 9,16 but aimed at the Israelites, when He said: “that the only reason He had not yet killed Pharaoh was so that in the course of more plagues you, the Jewish people, would come to recognise both G’d’s greatness and His patience.“ He also wanted the Jewish people to learn how to both love and revere Him when they witnessed and thought about the meaning of all these plagues. There can be no question that without G’d stiffening Pharaoh’s attitude from time to time, he would have collapsed much sooner and would have sent the Israelites on their desired journey. However, this would not have been the result of his repentance and humbling himself before the Lord, involving genuine regret about his previous errors, but the result of his impotence to withstand the pressure applied to him. He would have acted out of terror of what the next plague would do to him and to his country. If we needed confirmation of this, all we have to do is look at what his servants said to him when Moses threatened with the plague of locust. They said to him: “how long will you be obstinate, do you not see that Egypt will go down the drain?!” There was not a single word of regret of past errors, no word of recognition that G’d could have killed them all long before this and that He must therefore be very patient, and kind, but mere terror forced them to utter these words. (10,7) Keeping all this in mind, it is foolish to ask how G’d could punish Pharaoh after he Himself had interfered with his decision-making process by “stiffening his heart,” ואני אקשה את לב פרעה, I will stiffen the heart of Pharaoh, etc.” not in order to punish him but in order to finally trigger repentance in his heart. The operative clause is “in order that I can demonstrate all these miracles of Mine in his midst” (10,1), the purpose being to bring about his humbling himself in repentance and genuine contrition. If that wish of G’d would indeed materialise, the Jewish people also would tell of G’d’s greatness, (למען ספר את שמי, having observed at first hand how the mightiest secular power on earth turned into G’d fearing human beings.) They would tell their children and children’s children the lesson they had learned that G’d’s apparent cruelty is actually an act of loving kindness as it results in His creatures coming to love and to revere Him. [Noach, who had survived the destruction of mankind by a deliberate act of G’d’s kindness to him and his family, had not been able to relate to his children what G’d hoped that the Israelites would be able to relate to their children. Ed.] The basic lesson in ethics we derive from all this is that when suffering an affliction we must first and foremost examine our past actions to find out where we went wrong, and try to find out what these afflictions are intended to trigger in our memory so that we can improve our conduct both vis-à-vis G’d and our fellow man.']"
Exodus, 7,4,"[""ולא ישמע אליכם פרעה; not before the plague materialises after the warning, nor even after the plague did come to pass. He will not listen to you even after having endured many such plagues. Seeing that this is so, I will be forced to bring retribution upon them. This retribution will take the form of the killing of the firstborn as well as the drowning of all the military might of Egypt in the sea. The retribution will be seen as a punishment to fit their crimes. All the other plagues are only designed to encourage repentance, not as a form of retribution. Four times the Torah introduces this objective of the plagues. In 7,17 the Torah writes למען תדע כי אני ה', “so that you will know that I am the Lord.” In 8,18 the Torah writes: בעבור תדע כי אני ה' בקרב הארץ, “so that you will know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth (not only in heaven).” In 9,29 the Torah writes: למען שיתי אותותי אלה בקרבו ולמען תספר...וידעתם, “this is why I perform all these miracles of Mine right in its midst, so that you will tell…. and finally realise that there is no one like Me anywhere (9,14).”""]"
Exodus, 7,6,"[""ויעש משה ואהרן כאשר צוה ה' אותם, after every instruction from G’d they followed the same procedure. Moses used to announce beforehand what would happen, seeing that he was G’d’s emissary. After that Aaron would translate what Moses had said into diplomatic language."", 'כן עשו, they would do exactly this, not adding or subtracting anything of their own. ']"
Exodus, 7,7,"['ומשה בן שמונים שנה, even though he was an aged man both he and his brother rose early in the morning to do their Creator’s bidding. Although some people lived to a ripe old age in those days, eighty was an age which was considered as very much part of what we call “old age.” We know from David in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.90.10"" data-ref=""Psalms 90:10"">Psalms 90,10</a> that reaching the age of 80 was considered an exceptional feat, i.e. kindness of G’d.']"
Exodus, 7,9,"['תנו לכם מופת, “identify yourselves by means of a miracle which shows that the One Who has sent you is capable of carrying out what He promises so that we should obey Him. The expression אות as opposed to מופת is meant to identify the messenger, i.e. to prove that he is not a pretender, a charlatan. This was the reason why Moses performed אותות before the Israelites so that they should not entertain any doubt as to his being an authentic messenger from G’d to them. Pharaoh, whose doubts did not relate to the authenticity of Moses as the people’s representative, had to be convinced of the identity of the G’d who Moses claimed had sent him. It was he who had said that he did not recognise even the existence of such a G’d. Hence Moses had to perform miracles proving that such a G’d did in fact exist. The fact that the same miracle could help establish two separate facts is no hindrance to Moses performing the same miracle in two locations for two different audiences.']"
Exodus, 7,12,"['ויהיו לתנינים, they looked and felt like these kinds of monsters. They were not able to move like these monsters move, or even not at all.', 'ויבלע מטה אהרן את מטותם, this would demonstrate that only the G’d in heaven can grant life to inert phenomena, something Pharaoh’s sorcerers were unable to do.']"
Exodus, 7,14,"['כבד לב פרעה, even though Pharaoh could not help but notice the qualitative difference between what the sorcerers had done and what Moses and Aaron had accomplished.']"
Exodus, 7,15,"['נהפך לנחש, not only in appearance but also in its movements. This is implied by the word ויבלע, “it swallowed” (verse 12). We encountered this phenomenon already in 4,3 when Moses himself fled from the serpent his staff had turned into.']"
Exodus, 7,17,"[""'בזאת תדע כי אני ה; I will turn something that never changes in nature and never ceases to flow, into something else. This will demonstrate My power over natural law.""]"
Exodus, 7,18,"['והדגה אשר ביאור תמות, the river will not retain the appearance of a river, part of it has been turned into blood; but the entire river bed will be filled with blood so that the fish have no habitat in which to survive.', 'ונלאו מצרים, digging around the river bed trying to find water. This referred to what the Torah described in verse 24 ויחפרו כל מצרים סביבות היאור, “all the Egyptians dug all around the river.” ']"
Exodus, 7,23,"['ולא שת לבו גם לזאת, to recognise the difference between what G’d had done and what his sorcerers had done. G’d’s activity had produced a total change in the nature of the river Nile, a phenomenon which had been considered as inviolate, constant, incapable of being abolished. It had now been turned into “real blood,” so much so that all the fish had died. The changes effected by the tricks of the sorcerers were performed on phenomena that were unstable to begin with. Possibly, all the sorcerers produced was make believe, an illusion of blood. ']"
Exodus, 8,3,"['ויעלו את הצפרדעים, the ones produced by the sorcerers were unable to reproduce themselves, as were those that Aaron had produced. The sorcerers were never able to produce any creature that could move on its own. [It is important to realise that our author considers the צפרדע as a type of crocodile, the major danger to humans and fish inhabiting the Nile. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 8,4,"[""'העתירו אל ה, he did pay attention to the aspect of getting rid of this plague, recognising that there was some use in calling on the G’d of the Israelites to remove the plague.""]"
Exodus, 8,5,"['למתי אעתיר לך?. In order that you will recognise the difference between what your sorcerers are able to do and what G’d is capable of doing. When Moses offered two scenarios to Pharaoh, i.e. when the crocodiles would die, and henceforth restricting them to the river Nile, he also had in mind that whatever the sorcerers had done would be strictly limited in duration, and things would return to normal, whereas G’d could maintain the changes He had effected in nature indefinitely, totally or partially as He wished.']"
Exodus, 8,6,"['כדברך, in accordance with your wish. You had stipulated that the crocodiles should be removed from yourself, and from your people,” (verse 4) you did not ask for them to be eliminated from nature as a species.', ""למען תדע כי אין כה' אלוקנו, that there is no power in the universe other than the G’d of the Israelites who possesses the power to fundamentally effect changes in natural law. At that time, consigning crocodiles exclusively to the river Nile was a fundamental change in the habitat of this species. This species is different from all other known species in that instead of moving its lower jaw when eating, it moves its upper jaw. It also ingests food without excreting waste products. G’d will banish the species only from you and your houses, as this is all you asked for.""]"
Exodus, 8,7,"['וסרו הצפרדעים, G’d will not only remove the ones which have already bothered you, but He will ensure that they will not again afflict you.', 'ממך ומבתיך, but not from the whole country; on the contrary, they will die in the land and cause a stench, but in the future they will not leave their habitat in or near the river.\n']"
Exodus, 8,8,"[""ויצעק משה אל ה' על דבר הצפרדעים אשר שם לפרעה, Moses prayed that G’d remove only the crocodiles which had been sent against Pharaoh and his people, whereas any others should remain in the river. It required a special prayer, here described as an outcry, to ask G’d how to arrange the removal of this plague.""]"
Exodus, 8,11,"['כי היתה הרוחה, even though the evil had not been removed totally, seeing that the stench of the dead beasts remained and putrefied the atmosphere, and these beasts remained in the river as a possible threat in the future.', 'והכבד את לבו, He reinforced his natural courage not to be frightened of a re-emergence of the crocodiles that had remained alive. He was also willing to put up with the stench of the decaying beasts. All of this rather than to admit his impotence vis-à-vis the G’d of the Israelites.']"
Exodus, 8,12,"['והך את עפר הארץ, they did not warn Pharaoh of the advent of this plague. Neither did they warn him before the onset of the שחין, the boils and blisters, nor before the darkness. The nine plagues, exclusive of the killing of the firstborn, were intended to serve as demonstrations of G’d’s power to change the laws of nature. Although the simultaneous dying of the firstborn was also a powerful such demonstration, it was intended as retribution for refusal to heed all the warnings G’d had extended to Pharaoh and his people. The first 3 plagues דצ\'ך, demonstrated mastery of G’d over the two “heavy” components of the four basic elements the universe is made of, i.e. water and earth, The three plagues, abbreviated under the heading of עד\'ש by Rabbi Yehudah Hanassi, demonstrates G’d’s control not only over inert parts of nature but also over living creatures. The third category בא\'ח, demonstrated G’d complete control of the air, the atmosphere including the other two basic elements known as רוח and אש, air, wind, and fire. In each group the first two plagues were preceded by warnings, whereas the third was not. The matter has been alluded to in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.33.29"" data-ref=""Job 33:29"">Job 33,29</a> הן כל אלה יפעל א-ל, פעמים שלוש עם גבר. “Truly, G’d does all these things, two or three times to a man.”']"
Exodus, 8,14,['ולא יכולו. They were unable to produce anything which could truly move on its own.']
Exodus, 8,17,"['וגם האדמה אשר הם עליה, a reference to the soil on which the houses stood which would become full of snakes and other creepers of the kind that inhabit the lower levels of the earth beneath its surface. The plague would result in the Egyptians feeling insecure in their homes even when they had shut every exit tightly.']"
Exodus, 8,19,"['ושמתי פדות בין עמי ובין עמך, so that even the few members of my people who might be in an area infested by the arov would not be molested by these beasts. The same beasts would harm your people on the same spot.']"
Exodus, 8,26,"['ויעתר, in order for G’d to remove the wild beasts at the time which Pharaoh had requested and in the manner  he had asked for. We know that this time Pharaoh did not want to have to contend with the stench of the dead animals as he had had to when the crocodiles died on his territory, but that G’d made all these beasts retreat to where they had been before they had invaded the urban areas of Egypt. (compare verse 27) ']"
Exodus, 8,28,"['גם בפעם הזאת, as he had done after the plague of the crocodiles had been removed. Seeing that the wild beasts had only retreated to their lairs and had not died, so that they still represented a potential threat, Pharaoh toughened his resolve and refused to send off the people.']"
Exodus, 9,8,"['לעיני פרעה. In order that he would see that the plague was not the result of mixing something moist with something else, i.e. something subject to the influence of the sun or the atmosphere. Both of these phenomena sometimes produce what are known as “natural disasters.”']"
Exodus, 9,12,"['.\'ויחזק ה, G’d needed to reinforce Pharaoh’s heart as without this he would not have been able to endure this plague without his resistance collapsing. We know how Satan expected Job to react to the same affliction, from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.2.5"" data-ref=""Job 2:5"">Job 2,5</a> “if You lay a hand on his bones and flesh he will surely blaspheme.”']"
Exodus, 9,14,"['כי בפעם הזאת, this time when I demonstrate My power over the third category of phenomena, the atmosphere and what it contains, אני שולח את כל מגפותי אל לבך ובעבדיך ובעמך, every plague which I am about to send will affect each one of you even after the plague itself departs. The damage caused by the plague while it was active will be felt long after the plague has departed. The after-effect could be felt because of the vegetables remaining having suffered damage from the hail. The unnatural type of darkness would also leave behind it unpleasant after-effects, as the whole atmosphere would have been affected during the period of no light. If we consider that for three days running no one could even rise from his chair or bed, we can imagine that this was not merely an absence of daylight. The plagues that had preceded the hail had not left behind them permanent after-effects.', 'בעבור תדע כי אין כמוני בכל הארץ,  this realisation will come to you when you observe how I enjoy complete mastery of the atmosphere. G’d reserved the demonstration that He also had complete control of all the phenomena in outer space, or in extra terrestrial regions for the time when He split the Sea of Reeds. When the Egyptians observed the movements of the pillars of fire and the columns of cloud, all of which moved in a manner which reflected that they were being directed by a higher power. ']"
Exodus, 9,16,"['בעבור הראותך את כחי, so that you may finally display repentance. In the final analysis, I am not interested in the death of the sinner but in his rehabilitation through his own efforts.

Exodus, 9,19,"['ועתה שלח העז את מקנך, in order that also the servants supervising the cattle would escape the hail together with their herds.. If G’d cared about the beasts, He most certainly cared about the human beings, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Pirkei_Avot.3.18"" data-ref=""Pirkei Avot 3:18"">Avot 3,18</a> חביב אדם כי נברא בצלם, “man is beloved as he (alone) has been created in G’d’s image.”']"
Exodus, 9,20,"[""הירא את דבר ה' הניס, G’d continues explaining to Moses that the reason He had told Moses to advise the Egyptians to bring their cattle under cover was that he knew that anyone genuinely afraid of G’d’s warnings would avail himself of this warning and save himself and his herds.""]"
Exodus, 9,21,"['ואשר לא שם לבו חטא ויעזוב, it would become clear that he who sinned paid with his life. This is why I warn you now to save your lives.']"
Exodus, 9,23,"['ותהלך אש ארצה, the atmosphere which had already been heated descended earthward with the same speed as the hail. [Normally, fire has a tendency to rise into higher levels of the atmosphere. Here, the reverse happened. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 9,24,['ואש מתלקחת בתוך הברד. Driven by the immense velocity and pressure of the descending hailstones. The heat generated in the atmosphere resulted in unnatural sounds being heard everywhere. Both hard and soft plants were destroyed by the hail. Verse 25 spells all this out in detail.']
Exodus, 9,29,"[""כצאתי את העיר, even though you have said to me that you have endured already enough of this the plague will not cease until I have left the boundaries of the capital and only then הקולות יחדלון והברד לא יהיה עוד למען תדע כי לה' הארץ, all of these phenomena will occur simultaneously, in contrast to the natural order of things. This will not happen as a result of My thinking that you have already become a penitent, regretting his sins; on the contrary your education has not yet been completed, ידעתי כי טרם תיראון, I am fully aware that you still do not relate to the Creator with reverence and awe.""]"
Exodus, 9,31,"['והפשתה והשעורה, even though both the flax crop and the barley crop had been wiped out by the hail, something which caused tremendous damage to the Egyptian economy.']"
Exodus, 9,32,"['והחטה והכסמת, take note of the extent of the wickedness of Pharaoh and his servants. Even though the wheat and the spelt had not yet been destroyed, and Moses had prayed for the removal of the plague of hail, and Pharaoh had observed that all the destructive forces had ceased to be active as an immediate result of Moses’ prayer, something which made plain that but for Moses’ prayer the destruction would have continued, Pharaoh heaped more sins on top of the ones already committed, so as to make the ultimate retribution he would suffer even more terrible.']"
Exodus, 9,35,"['ויחזק לב פרעה, not without an assist from external forces. What happened was precisely as G’d had told Moses and Aaron at the time when G’d appointed Aaron as Moses’ helper; “and I know that the King of Egypt will not voluntarily allow you to leave Egypt.” G’d had even added: “ולא ביד חזקה, I do not want him to give his consent as a sign of his impotence against My strong hand.” G’d wanted Pharaoh to become a penitent while believing he could still offer resistance if he chose. Pharaoh had convinced himself after every plague that G’d had already exhausted the punitive means at His disposal, and that He could do no more to him. [When Maimonides in the third chapter of hilchot Teshuvah enumerates 24 categories of sins which result in the sinners either being unable to do teshuvah, or to face almost insurmountable obstacles in doing so, one of them is this belief that if G’d instead of liquidating them had stopped short of that, this is proof that He could not do any more than He had already done. Pharaoh made this fatal mistake out of his arrogance. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 10,1,"[""כי אני הכבדתי, even though Moses had said; “I know that you do not yet relate with awe and reverence to G’d,” (9,30) he thought that even if he does not humble himself to G’d because of G’d’s greatness, at least he should do what G’d says seeing that he has no choice, and can no longer withstand the cumulative effect of the plagues. He had arrived at this conclusion when he noted the words ה' הצדיק, “the Lord is the Just One.” However, when he found out that all these pious words notwithstanding Pharaoh continued to oppose G’d’s will in spite of the fact that he found it impossible to cope with the plagues, Moses had come to the conclusion that warning Pharaoh of an impending plague was an exercise in futility. This is why G’d had to tell him at this stage that already during the sixth plague (9,12) He had stiffened Pharaoh’s heart so that ordinary rules of psychology could no longer be applied to this man. The purpose was to enable G’d to demonstrate more miracles so that maybe some Egyptians would be moved by what they experienced to become penitents. If so, the Israelites in the future would be able to tell their children of the greatness of G’d’s miracles. This in turn would convince mankind that G’d loved His creatures and was very patient with them, giving them opportunities to mend their ways. This is why the warning to Pharaoh was in place although it would prove ineffectual. G’d’s plan was"", 'למען שיתי אותותי אלה אלה בקרבו, so that I can demonstrate these miracles of Mine in its midst, so that the people realise My greatness and return in contriteness.']"
Exodus, 10,2,"['ולמען תספר, and so that you Israelites will be able to tell about My attributes and remember this throughout future generations.']"
Exodus, 10,3,"['עד מתי מענת, seeing that in the meantime I have demonstrated to you My dominance even in the atmosphere, how much longer will you refuse to humble yourself seeing that I control the very air you need to breathe? Seeing that you were not impressed, there is no sense in hoping that you will be impressed by the overwhelming show of strength represented by the plagues. However, perhaps if the impact of the miracle itself did not make an impression on you, perhaps the drawn out duration of the effect of the plagues may finally have the desired effect. This is why the question  “how long must a plague continue before it will have the desired effect?” is not out of place.']"
Exodus, 10,5,"['ואכל את כל העץ, it will destroy it. The word אכל here is used in the same sense as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.79.7"" data-ref=""Psalms 79:7"">Psalms 79,7</a> כי אכל את יעקב, “for he has consumed Yaakov,” i.e. destroyed him. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.31.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 31:17"">Deuteronomy 31,17</a> והיה לאכול also means “that it may be destroyed.”']"
Exodus, 10,10,"['כאשר אשלח אתכם ואת טפכם, even less your livestock.', 'ראו כי רעה נגד פניכם. I warn you that what you have in mind will boomerang on you and instead of improving your lot will worsen it.

When he will send the whole people of Israel from his land, he will act under a similar type of stress.', 'כלה גרש יגרש אתכם, at that time he had only expelled the two of you. This time he will expel all of you from this entire country. This is the attribute of G’d’s justice at work. When a person obstinately insists on not performing the expressed will of his Creator, (owner) he will ultimately have to do what he tried to avoid doing under infinitely worse circumstances. The Torah had warned us in Deuteronomy in Moses’ famous speech of admonition that because the Jewish people had refused to observe G’d’s commandments joyfully, out of a feeling of gratitude for their success in the Holy Land, they would ultimately still have to do what G’d wanted them to do, and what they had contracted to do, by serving G’d’s servants [host nations in the land of our exile.

Exodus, 11,2,"['דבר נא באזני העם וישאלו, they needed to be encouraged to ask for this as they might have worried about the Egyptians pursuing them in order to retrieve their riches.  It worked in reverse; the very fact that the Egyptians chased after the Israelites, i.e. reneged, was the immediate reason G’d came to the Israelites’ assistance and drowned their pursuers. That is what made them absolutely free.']"

Exodus, 11,5,"['מבכור פרעה עד בכור השפחה, from the highest layer of Egyptian society to the most lowly. When we read a similar line in 12,19 the meaning is “from the most severe sinner to the relatively least guilty sinner.”']"
Exodus, 11,6,"['אשר כמוהו לא נהיתה, never had there been such an outcry in any of the nights the Egyptians had known. The reason was that this was not a night during which a battle was being waged against the enemies of the Egyptians, an occasion when there are many outcries in the city, as we know from Tzefaniah 1,10 “a loud outcry from the fish gate and howling from the Mishneh, and a great sound of anguish from the hills. The dwellers of the Machtesh howl.” This was a night during which Egypt was at peace. Never again would there be such an outcry in the midst of peace.']"
Exodus, 11,8,"['ואחרי כן אצא, I will not leave Egypt at once, as you have requested from me, but afterwards, in the morning.']"
Exodus, 11,9,"[""ויאמר ה' אל משה לא ישמע אליכם פרעה, G’d told him that the reason why Pharaoh would not react positively to Moses’ warning was simply that He, G’d, had stiffened his heart in order to be able to demonstrate more miracles. This was designed to teach both the Egyptians and the Israelites the multi-faceted power of G’d, as well as His goodness, as He had said: “you will know that I am Hashem.” (10,2) Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles in order to fulfill what G’d had wanted to demonstrate through human messengers. Now, that the time had come to punish the Egyptians, not to demonstrate miracles, and to save the Israelites, i.e. at least the ones that deserved being saved, and also to destroy the Egyptian deities, G’d introduces the part the Passover was to play in this end-game. This portion commences with 12,12-13. G’d wanted that the command-ment of the Passover be communicated to the people by both Moses and Aaron so that just as Moses and Aaron both had had a part to play in their confrontation with Pharaoh, they should also have a similar part to play in getting the Israelites to perform the two commandments which would qualify them to take advantage of Pharaoh’s downfall, i.e. their own salvation, the Exodus. Only in this way would Moses and Aaron reap the reward of all their efforts so far.""]"
Exodus, 12,2,"['החודש הזה לכם ראש חדשים, from now on these months will be yours, to do with as you like. [you have My authority to organise your own calendar.

Exodus, 12,4,"['ושכנו הקרוב אל ביתו.

The author of the Haggadah shel Pessach paraphrases this by writing אני הוא ולא אחר, “I alone and no one else.” This expression explains all that has been written before, i.e. why in this instance G’d personally had to mete out the retribution as opposed to the angel who killed 185,000 men of Sancheriv’s army all in the same night without assistance. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.19.35"" data-ref=""II Kings 19:35"">Kings II 19,35</a>) There the angel did not have to divine who was a firstborn and who was not.']"

Had it not been for the “passing over” He had performed as an act of pity for the Israelites, they would not have escaped that judgment even if their firstborn had not been killed. The matter is similar to what the angel had told Lot concerning his not turning around, when he warned פן תספה בעון העיר, “lest you will be wiped out on account of the guilt of the people inside the city.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.19.15"" data-ref=""Genesis 19:15"">Genesis 19,15</a>) G’d commanded the Israelites to smear the blood as a sign so that they would escape.

Exodus, 12,22,"['מן הדם אשר בסף, so that every sprinkling be preceded by immersion of the hyssop in the blood, in accordance with G’d’s instructions in verse 6 “on the two upright posts and the lintel.” The sprinkling of the upright posts with the blood had to precede that of the lintel. This could not be accomplished unless there had been three separate sprinklings to reflect the three letters י which served G’d as a means with which to create the universe. This is based on the saying in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Menachot.29"" data-ref=""Menachot 29"">Menachot 29</a> that the world of the future (or the world in which we spend our afterlife) was created with the letter י, as opposed to the material universe we live in now, which was created with the letter ה. The other two occasions when the letter י symbolised a world in a state of perfection was before Adam had sinned in Gan Eden, and on the day the Jewish people accepted the Torah at Mount Sinai until the day they sinned with the golden calf (40 days) All this is based on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.26.4"" data-ref=""Isaiah 26:4"">Isaiah 26,4</a> כי בי-ה ה\' צור עולמים. The reason why the letter י is presumed to symbolise this kind of perfection is that it is a mere dot (when written) and requires no physical outline, צורה, as do all the other letters. Not only that, the uniqueness of that letter symbolises the uniqueness of the Creator Who presides over two universes both of infinite duration, or over heaven and earth (one single universe consisting of two parts both parts of which are eternal). ', 'ואתם לא תצאו, from the house which has been marked with blood. ופסח, and in this fashion G’d will skip, pass-over.

Exodus, 12,23,"['לנגוף, to afflict them with the afflictions G’d will visit on the Egyptian people other than deadly plagues.

Exodus, 12,27,"['זבח פסח הוא, this offering commemorates the skipping over by G’d of each individual Jewish home, something that occurred at midnight.

He had reserved this night for that event because He is so full of loving kindness.

Both the coaches materialised miraculously, as well as the many donkeys needed to transport the new found riches of the people. Seeing that the donkeys had therefore had a constructive part to play in the redemption of the Israelites, this is reflected in their not being treated like all other impure beasts.

The aggressive ability of any army depends on its officer corps and the intelligence of the generals to devise schemes and battle plans which will lead to victory.']"
Exodus, 14,8,"['ובני ישראל יוצאים ביד רמה, the meaning of the word רמה here is similar to the meaning of the same word in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.27"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:27"">Deuteronomy 32,27</a> ידינו רמה, where it means: “our own hand has prevailed.” At the time of their departure they had been confident of their ability to defeat Pharaoh and his military machine as they were much stronger in numbers. The verse teaches that they were relying on their numbers instead of considering their total lack of experience in the art of war. They would have had every reason to fear the numerically inferior Egyptians who had all this experience going for them.']"
Exodus, 14,9,"['וירדפו מצרים, after the ones who had departed with such high regard for their superiority.']"
Exodus, 14,10,"['ופרעה הקריב, he had brought the entire Egyptian army right up close to the Israelites.']"
Exodus, 14,11,"['לקחתנו למות במדבר, even if Pharaoh and his army will not provoke a battle the mere fact that they block our path will result in our death in the desert from thirst and starvation.']"
Exodus, 14,15,"[""מה תצעק אלי?; G’d’s question seems at first glance redundant, seeing that Moses’ outcry could have been perceived as part of the nation’s outcry in verse 10, i.e. ויצעקו בני ישראל וגו'.However, Moses’ outcry had nothing to do with being afraid of the pursuing Egyptians. He had already predicted the downfall and death of Pharaoh and his army as being so decisive that Egypt as a world power would never again pose a serious threat to the Jews. (verse 13-14) He had also told the people that G’d would do the fighting for them and that all they had to do was to remain silent. Moses’ outcry was one of concern with the rebellious attitude of the people who not only were afraid, something that could be forgiven, but who had dared to be sarcastic in their hour of danger, ridiculing Moses’ leadership to the point where he was afraid that they would refuse to enter the sea when told to. G’d told Moses that he had no right to assume such a thing, that in fact he was suspecting innocent people of lack of faith."", 'דבר אל בני ישראל ויסעו, G’d is challenging Moses to issue the order to move forward, assuring him that he will see immediately that the people will respond positively.']"
Exodus, 14,16,"['הרם את מטך, in the direction of the east wind so that it will cause the sea bed to dry out.', 'ונטה את ידך על הים, so that the waters will split to the two opposite sides of the shore, similar to what the prophet Elijah would do in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.2.8"" data-ref=""II Kings 2:8"">Kings II 2,8</a>.']"

Exodus, 14,19,"['ההולך לפני מחנה, in the column of fire.', 'וילך מאחריהם, in order to (melt) dissolve the very chunks of water which had frozen in order to enable the Israelites to cross on a dry seabed, and to turn the seabed into a slimy mass which would spell doom for the Egyptians. At this juncture there was no need for the pillar of cloud to be at the head of the marching Israelites. The dry path in the water was their guide ', 'ויעמד מאחריהם. behind the Israelites and behind the column of fire.']"
Exodus, 14,20,"[' ויבא (המלאך) בין מחנה מצרים ובין ישראל; in order to guide the two pillars.', 'ויהי הענן והחשך, the darkness of night together with the cloud was positioned behind Israel and the column of fire.', 'ויאר את הלילה, and the angel illuminated the night by means of the column of fire. By removing the darkness in that spot and forward only, the pillar of cloud still shielded the Israelites from being seen by the Egyptians.', 'ולא קרב זה אל זה כל הלילה. This was because the Egyptians who had previously had the advantage of speed over the Israelites who traveled only on foot, now were slowed down by having to move in darkness.']"

At that time the waters began to reverse themselves meeting the Egyptians who were now near the wrong end of this trough, head on.', 'וינער ה\' את מצרים, G’d tossed Egypt, King and all from all the chariots to the bottom of the sea.

Exodus, 14,29,"['ובני ישראל הלכו ביבשה, all the while the Egyptians experienced all these problems and were drowning, the Israelites had been walking trough the sea as if it were dry land.

Exodus, 15,11,"['מי כמוכה בא-לים; Moses praised the Lord for His third war, the one against the Egyptian cavalry of the second quality.

Exodus, 15,16,"['תפול עליהם אימתה ופחד בגדול זרועך, may it be Your will that fear will overcome them in a manner which will make them flee because they are afraid of Your arm.

Exodus, 15,25,"[""ושם נסהו, to find out if they would be willing to accept statutes (laws not given to our intelligence to understand,) as well as social legislation and they would not ignore it when they were not in a state of crisis as now when they needed water through a miracle.אם שמוע תשמע לקול ה' אלוקיך, to accept the statutes which would follow as a way of life, not merely as emergency regulation in the desert, and if from now on they would הישר בעיניו תעשה והאזנת למצותיו, וגו, carefully observe G’d’s commandments endeavouring to live according to their understanding of what is pleasing to Him, then they would be permanently spared any of the afflictions that G’d had brought upon the Egyptians. The implication was that betraying G’d’s trust would have painful consequences. The entire experience is a reminder of the manner in which the Rabbis relate to a potential convert to Judaism. One does not present Judaism in rosy attractive colours so as to encourage him to convert, but on the contrary, one apprises him first and foremost of the עול המצות, “the yoke of the commandments,” telling him of all the things he would have to forego by joining the Jewish people, i.e. the Jewish religion. Moreover, one advises him that whereas up until now he was able to eat certain foods, such as chelev, not only would he no longer be able to eat these foods, but violation of the commandment would carry the penalty of karet, loss of entitlement to his afterlife, etc. Only after he has duly absorbed this information does one proceed with teaching him the intricacies of Judaism. What happened at Marah was preparatory to accepting Judaism at Mount Sinai. If the people had not gone through this process it is doubtful that they would have said נעשה ונשמע, “we will do, now let us learn G’d’s Torah,” when the time came for this a few weeks later."", 'כי אני ה\' רופאך, the point of all this is that once you have accepted the statutes and then fail to honour your commitment you will be subject to punishment by G’d. These punishments will be in the nature of being self-inflicted as all of G’d’s commandments are designed to make your life on earth and beyond a healthy life. Failure to honour your commitment will expose you to all the negative influences which abound on earth. I have shown you that I can cure harmful waters, waters which humans cannot drink. This is only a sample of what My commandments and observing them can do for you. We, today, do not know what kind of wood or tree G’d told Moses to throw into these waters. The Torah deliberately did not reveal this information. Even if all the trees in the world would be the kind that G’d told Moses to throw into the water, and even if we would throw all this wood into only a minute quantity of water the result would be nil. On the other hand, if, by the grace of G’d, one throws even a minute quantity of such wood into even an entire ocean, the waters of the ocean would suddenly become drinking water. [my addition. Ed.] <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.20.26"" data-ref=""Leviticus 20:26"">Leviticus 20,26</a> states clearly that G’d separates the Jewish people from the surrounding nations.

Exodus, 16,3,"['מי יתן מותנו...בשבתנו על סיר הבשר, they did not want to die.

Exodus, 16,4,"['והכינו את אשר יביאו והיה משנה, not literally: “bread,” but מזון, “food.”', 'למען אנסנו הילך בתורתי, if when receiving their food without effort they will take care to keep My commandments, seeing they will then not have any excuses not to. This idea has been formulated in the classic statement by our sages in the Mechilta, section ויסע chapter 2 “the Torah, as an instrument of profound study, has been given only to the generation who ate the manna.” [no other generation had so little to distract it from devoting time to Torah study. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 16,5,"['והכינו את אשר, even after having prepared the food from the raw manna it will still be twice the quantity it had been on the previous days. It will not shrink in the course of preparation. The reason G’d speaks of והכינו, “they will prepare it,” is to encourage the people to prepare for the Sabbath by observing it with delicacies, especially tasty food. They should concentrate on all this on the Sabbath eve.']"
Exodus, 16,6,"['ערב וידעתם, may it be G’d’s will that what He said about giving you food will be such that in the evening you will receive enough for that evening so that you will all know that He has taken you out of Egypt, totally and irrevocably. You have also exited from the political leaders of that country. True, you had been sitting near the fleshpots there, but you had never been given enough time to enjoy any of the meat in these pots. You had been treated like animals which have no fixed times when they eat. This is the meaning of the passage in Yuma 75 in which we are told that at the beginning of your history (of the enslavement) you were like hens that are only able to hastily pick at the kernels given them as food. They even had to look for it in the refuse heaps. Only after Moses, their redeemer, took over their affairs did they begin to enjoy regular meals at regular times.']"
Exodus, 16,7,"['ובוקר, in the morning you will have bread,', ""'וראיתם את כבוד ה, and may it be G’d’s will that you will see Hashem’s glory when He will set limits to various times of the day, so that you will know that your complaints addressed to Aaron and myself should really have been addressed to Him, seeing it is He who will remove the cause of these complaints.""]"
Exodus, 16,8,"[""ויאמר משה בתת ה' לכם, Moses said: as far as your prayer to G’d to give you food in the evening in a way which makes it plain that that G’d took you out of Egypt and not we, is that we had in mind בערב בשר לאכול, He will give you meat to eat in the evening; to eat, but not to satiate yourself on; unlike the Egyptians who are only concerned with the cravings of their bodies; therefore only בבקר לשובע only in the morning will G’d give you bread to satiate your body’s requirements. As to our having prayed that G’d would show you His glory, this referred to His answering your complaints."", ""בשמוע ה' את תלונותיכם, concerning our prayer that you will be able to see the glory of Hashem our intention was that you will realise from His reaction that your complaints were not addressed to us, or should not have been addressed to us, but to Him.

Exodus, 16,9,"['אמור אל כל עדת, seeing that Moses knew that their prayer had been accepted, as in the case of Rabbi Chanina who claimed that while praying for the sick he could feel if G’d responded positively.(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.34"" data-ref=""Berakhot 34"">Berachot 34</a>).', ""'קרבו לפני ה, “come close to the proximity of Hashem,” Moses referred to the pillar of cloud which traveled in front of the Israelites and represented the presence of G’d.""]"

Some would take more, others less but איש לפי אכלו עומר לגלגלת, מספר נפשותיכם איש לאשר באהלו תקחו, it would not matter how much they would collect, for when they would measure it they would find that each one had exactly one omer per family member in his tent. Every Israelite would receive (ultimately) an equal share of the heavenly food G’d would provide. It would satisfy him in accordance with the amount of food he was used to consume regularly. If someone was in the habit of eating relatively little, he would not now be able to change his eating habits and gorge himself. On the other hand, if someone was a glutton, receiving heavenly food would not require him to downsize his appetite. ']"
Exodus, 16,20,"['ויקצף עליהם משה, the reason that Moses was angry was that the leftover manna was not the result of it being more than the people could eat, but because it represented an attempt by the people to find out if what they had been warned of would really happen.']"
Exodus, 16,21,"['בבקר בבקר, each morning; the syntax is similar to that in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.39.10"" data-ref=""Genesis 39:10"">Genesis 39,10</a> where the words כדברה אל יוסף יום יום mean: “when she spoke to him (thus) each and every day.” We also have a similar line in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.30.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 30:7"">Exodus 30,7</a> when the Torah speaks about the daily procedure of cleaning the candelabra, writing בבקר בבקר בהיטיבו את הנרות, “every morning when he would clean out the lamps, etc.”', 'וחם השמש ונמס, this was the reason that the people would gather it up early in the morning so that it did not yet have a chance to melt from the heat.']"
Exodus, 16,23,"['את אשר תאפו, the portion of each day’s ration which they would bake in an oven. The subject has been referred to again in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.11.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 11:8"">Numbers 11,8</a> as ועשו אותו עוגות “they would make it into cakes.”', 'אפו!, now, on the Sabbath eve.

Exodus, 16,25,"['אכלוהו היום, at fixed times, from this date onward.', ""'כי שבת היום לה, this entire day is a Sabbath in honour of G’d. It was permitted to eat any manna left over from Friday on the entire Sabbath. However, if any was left over after the Sabbath it could not be eaten anymore."", 'היום לא תמצאוהו, on the entire Sabbath you will not find any manna on the ground anywhere just as you did not on this Sabbath.']"
Exodus, 16,27,"['יצאו מן העם, from their camp to the area where during the week the manna had been falling. These people thought that they would find some manna, possibly outside the usual parameter. This was a demonstration of lack of faith in the word of G’d.', 'ללקוט, this would have been an outright desecration of the Sabbath. Even carrying their containers was a desecration of the Sabbath. The <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.107"" data-ref=""Shabbat 107"">Talmud Shabbat 107</a> states that even something only peripherally attached to the ground, i.e. something which had not actually had grown in the earth, had roots, is nonetheless considered halachically as if it had been uprooted from the soil.']"
Exodus, 16,28,"['עד אנה מאנתם לשמור, the rebuke included Moses; although Moses, of course, had not gone out to look for manna on the Sabbbath, who is held co-responsible for the people going out as he had withheld information concerning the Sabbath given to him already at the beginning of the week. During the intervening days Moses should have used the time to teach the people the laws concerning the Sabbath. Moses’ specific error is recorded by the Torah in verse 26 when he told the people “you will gather it for six days and on the seventh day there will not be any.” He had not told the people that they must not go out looking for it. The people did not so much rebel against G’d as against the instructions they had received from Moses, when they did not believe him, assuming that he merely did not want them to waste their time looking for something that was not there. Moses should have taught the people that even gathering up manna was considered a forbidden activity on the Sabbath, that the one doing this was considered as if he had harvested it, cut it, on the Sabbath. Not only that, he would also become guilty for transporting it from the public domain to the private domain, another one of the 39 categories of activities on the Sabbath which are disallowed.', 'ותורותי, the general tenor of Sabbath observance and the reward and punishment associated with proper Sabbath observance.']"
Exodus, 16,29,"['ראו!, “try and understand!”', 'כי ה\' נתן לכם השבת, the Sabbath regulations are not merely prohibitions, etc, but first and foremost the Sabbath is a gift from G’d to you, a gift for you exclusively, something G’d did not give to any other nation. The <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.10"" data-ref=""Shabbat 10"">Talmud Shabbat 10</a> phrases it thus: “I have a precious gift in my treasure chamber, its name is “Sabbath.” I want to give it to the people of Israel.” Based on this concept of what the Sabbath is all about, the sages who formulated the Sabbath morning prayer, עמידה, emphasised that “You did not give it to the nations of the world, in fact they are not even allowed, being uncircumcised, to partake in the מנוחה, “the constructive rest, which is so characteristic of the Sabbath.” This is also echoed in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.31.16"" data-ref=""Exodus 31:16"">Exodus 31,16</a> ושמרו בני ישרל את השבת לעשות את השבת לדוררותם. “The Children of Israel are to observe the Sabbath to constructively make of it the Sabbath throughout their generations.” The implication is that proper observance of the Sabbath, its concept, will ensure that we will be around throughout the generations, will partake in the redemption.']"
Exodus, 16,35,"['אכלו את המן, in lieu of bread made from wheat or other cereals. The Israelites themselves testified to this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.11.6"" data-ref=""Numbers 11:6"">Numbers 11,6</a> when they said (complainingly) בלתי אל המן עינינו, “all we have to look at is the manna.”', 'עד בואם אל ארץ נושבת, inhabited countries, i.e. the lands conquered from Sichon and Og on the east bank of the Jordan river. Once they had taken over these lands they also ate regular bread. [a period of possibly six months before they crossed the Jordan. Ed.]', 'את המן אכלו עד בואם אל קצה ארץ כנען, the word את, meaning “with, in addition,” alludes to the fact that they no longer ate manna exclusively. We find further confirmation of this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.5.11-12"" data-ref=""Joshua 5:11-12"">Joshua 5,11-12</a> ויאכלו מעבור הארץ ממחרת הפסח...וישבות המן ממחרת, “they ate from the produce of the land, etc.,…the manna stopped on the morrow after the Passover.”\n']"
Exodus, 17,1,"['לשתות העם, that the people could drink. The unusual construction is similar to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.16.3"" data-ref=""Genesis 16:3"">Genesis 16,3</a> לשבת אברהם.']"
Exodus, 17,2,"['מה תריבון עמדי?; do you not know that I do not act arbitrarily but only carry out G’d’s orders?', '\'מה תנסון את ה?; if you really quarrel with me, this is equivalent to your quarrelling and testing the One whose agent I am. You are only endangering your own lives if you quarrel with G’d! If He becomes angry He will consider that He has to destroy you, seeing that He had demonstrated His power to you in deeds. We find Moses repeating this thought in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.95.9"" data-ref=""Psalms 95:9"">Psalms 95,9</a> אשר נסוני אבותיכם בחנוני גן ראו פעלי, “when your fathers put Me to the test, tried Me, though they had seen My deeds.” [when someone who had never had a manifestation of G’d’s power “tests” Him, this is far less serious than when the Jewish people who had ample proof of G’d’s power would do the same. Ed]']"
Exodus, 17,5,"['עבור לפני העם, and their complaints will cease when they see that you are making an effort to provide their needs.', 'ומטך אשר הכית בו את היאור, your staff with which you had smitten the river so that the Egyptians had given up looking for water to drink, will now perform the opposite function and provide you with drinking water.', 'והלכת. from the camp to the rock.']"
Exodus, 17,6,"['והכית בצור ושתה העם, this will teach them that the staff is not an instrument which performs certain functions naturally, being unable to change its functions. It will show you that the staff is an instrument carrying out the will of its owner. This is why it can be used to perform opposing functions on different occasions.']"
Exodus, 17,8,"['ויבא עמלק, at the sound of the people’s being frustrated with thirst. This is what Moses meant when he recalled the incident 40 years later in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.25.18"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 25:18"">Deuteronomy 25,18</a>  describing the Israelites’ state of mind at the time as ואתה עיף ויגע, “you were tired and worn out.” We find the expression עיף linked to water also in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.22.7"" data-ref=""Job 22:7"">Job 22,7</a> לא מים עייף תשקה, “You do not give the thirsty water to drink.” (Eliphaz accusing Job) We also find the word applied to earth itself in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.32.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 32:2"">Isaiah 32,2</a> בארץ עיפה, “in a languishing land.”']"
Exodus, 17,9,"['ומטה האלוקים בידי, to show the people at what time he would be praying in order that they too would coordinate the time they offered their own prayers with that of Moses. The importance of this harmonising of prayers is demonstrated when the Talmud tells us that in the large synagogue of Alexandria they waved flags so that the people who could not hear the cantor could pray in harmony with him, nonetheless. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sukkah.51"" data-ref=""Sukkah 51"">Sukkah 51</a>).']"
Exodus, 17,13,"['את עמלק ואת עמו, fellow travelers from other nations who had joined Amalek in his attack against the Israelites.']"
Exodus, 17,14,"['כתוב זאת זכרון בספר, a reference to the portion in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.25.17-19"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 25:17-19"">Deuteronomy 25,17-19</a>.', 'ושים באזני יהושע, make sure that Joshua remembers all this. Moses carried out this command by building the altar and offering up the prayer declaring G’d as his flag. ', 'מחה אמחה את זכר עמלק, not only the people but even their livestock. We know this from the instructions given by the prophet Samuel to King Sha-ul in Samuel 15,3 where the king is ordered to destroy utterly all the possessions of Amalek.']"
Exodus, 17,15,"['ויקרא שמו, he called the name of G’d in his prayer ה\' ניסי. The matter is similar to the prophet Jeremiah saying in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Lamentations.3.25"" data-ref=""Lamentations 3:25"">Lamentations 3,25</a>: קראתי שמך ה\'. Surely, there was nothing new in Jeremiah knowing the name of G’d. The point is that he addressed this attribute of G’d in that prayer. Moses addressed the attribute of G’d as the flag-bearer in Israel’s wars.', 'ה\' נסי, “G’d is my exaltation.” The meaning is similar to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.60.6"" data-ref=""Psalms 60:6"">Psalms 60,6</a> נתת ליראיך נס להתנוסס מפני קשט סלה, “You have given a banner to them that fear You, to raise themselves to its height before the might of wisdom.” In other words, the psalmist says that G’d will lend him the strength to cope with anyone trying to attack him and to overcome him. The same thought is expressed in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.44.6"" data-ref=""Psalms 44:6"">Psalms 44,6</a> בשמך נבוס קמינו, “with the help of Your name we will vanquish those who rise up against us.”']"
Exodus, 17,16,"['ויאמר כי יד על כס י-ה, Moses explains the reason and purpose of his prayer being the fact that G’d Himself had sworn an oath to remain at war with Amalek from generation to generation. If G’d is at war with that nation, we as G’d’s representative on earth, must certainly also be at war with that nation. It is what our sages referred to when they said that three commandments cannot be fulfilled until the Jewish people are securely settled in the land of Israel, 1) appointment of a king; 2) destroying the last vestiges of Amalek; 3) the building of a permanent Temple. Moses therefore had prayed for the time when these three hallmarks of Jewish history could be attained. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.20"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 20"">Sanhedrin 20</a>)']"
Exodus, 18,1,"['וישמע יתרו, the word שמיעה for hearing is used when recording or referring to something which did not occur at the time it is being reported. When one hears of something which is just happening, the Torah uses the term ראיה, “seeing,” i.e. first hand knowledge of something. It does not matter whether the sound of the happening comes from a distant location or is nearby within one’s eyesight. Examples of the use of the word ראיה “seeing” being used for matters which were heard second hand, not seen, are found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.42.1"" data-ref=""Genesis 42:1"">Genesis 42,1</a> where Yaakov, resident in the land of Canaan, is reported as “seeing” that there was grain for sale in Egypt. Clearly, the Torah refers to Yaakov having heard about it. Seeing the matter was not near at hand nor had occurred just then, the Torah used the words וירא יעקב, “Jacob saw.” A similar use of the word “seeing,” וירא for something not actually seen is <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.22.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 22:2"">Numbers 22,2</a> where Bileam is reported as “seeing” all that Israel had done to the Emorite kings. Bileam had not seen any of it, but had heard that the Israelites had defeated the two most powerful Emorite kings Sichon and Og. A third example confirming our theory would be <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.28.10"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 28:10"">Deuteronomy 28,10</a> where the people of the globe are reported as expressing their conviction that the Jewish people are G’d’s darlings and that they would therefore be in awe of them. Clearly, the people of the globe could not have “seen” this, but they had heard about the success of the Jewish nation. The events inspiring such feelings among the nations of the globe had occurred over a period of time, not all at once. However, if we understand the words כי הוציא as meaning כאשר הוציא, “when He took out,” we must understand Yitro as saying that he had heard all that G’d had done for Israel at the time when He took them out of Egypt. This would include a reference to all the plagues, the drowning of the Egyptians army, etc. It was this information which had prompted him to journey into the desert himself instead of sending a messenger who would accompany Tzipporah and her children so that they would be reunited with their husband/father. He was primarily motivated by his quest for G’d. This is similar to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Chronicles.32.31"" data-ref=""II Chronicles 32:31"">Chronicles II 32,31</a> where the king of Babylon wanted to have evidence of the reports he had received about the miraculous recovery from his illness which King Chizkiyah had experienced.']"
Exodus, 18,2,"['אחר שלוחיה. After she (Tzipporah) had sent a message to him to find out where they were encamped. Moses had informed her that the Israelites would not stop anywhere for any length of time until they would reach the mountain of G’d, Mount Chorev, where they would serve the Lord. She must have known about this as Moses must have told her of G’d’s prediction in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.3.12"" data-ref=""Exodus 3:12"">Exodus 3,12</a> that once out of Egypt the Jewish people would serve the Lord there at that mountain. This is the reason why it took Yitro so long before he came as he had to wait until the Jewish people would make camp for longer than one night.']"
Exodus, 18,4,"['ויצילני מחרב פרעה. At the time Eliezer was born the old king who had wanted to execute Moses had already been dead for a while. This is one of the reasons why the Torah mentioned this death in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.23"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:23"">Exodus 2,23</a>. At that time Moses felt secure from further attempts on his life. Pharaoh’s international police had an exceedingly long reach, just as that of Achav, King of Israel, who had been hunting for the prophet Elijah all over the neighbouring countries of Israel as documented in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.18.10"" data-ref=""I Kings 18:10"">Kings I 18,10</a> “is there any kingdom to which the king (Achav) has not sent emissaries to arrange to have to you captured?”']"
Exodus, 18,6,"['אני חותנך יתרו, Yitro sent this message as a matter of courtesy so that Moses would not be taken unawares by his sudden arrival. He complied with the sages’ warning “do not enter your own house without advance notice, how much more so the house of your friend.” (Pessachim 112).']"
Exodus, 18,7,"['ויצא משה, Moses did not stand on ceremony, using his position to await the arrival of his father-in-law at home, but he went some distance to meet the man in whose house he had received so many favours. We find that Queen Esther, similarly, did not use her elevation to Royalty as an excuse to no longer defer to Mordechai who had raised her. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Esther.2.20"" data-ref=""Esther 2:20"">Esther 2,20</a> “Esther continued to carry out Mordechai’s instructions as she had done when she lived under his roof.”) Joseph also did not use his exalted position to look down on his brothers. The Chief of the butlers, who had reason to be grateful to Joseph, is an example of ingratitude, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.40.23"" data-ref=""Genesis 40:23"">Genesis 40,23</a>, “he did not remember Joseph, in fact he erased him from his memory.”']"
Exodus, 18,8,"['את אשר עשה ה\' לפרעה ולמצרים על אודות ישראל. A reference to G’d performing vengeance as the avenger of His people. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.41"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:41"">Deuteronomy 32,41</a> for similar syntax used by Moses. when he quotes G’d as saying אשיב נקם לצרי, “vengeance will I wreak on My foes.” This referred to the Egyptians experiencing G’d’s retribution on their own bodies when they drowned in the sea. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.78.49"" data-ref=""Psalms 78:49"">Psalms 78,49</a> the psalmist describes 4, resp. 5 stages of G’d’s anger which the Egyptians had to experience before they died. Tthat verse is the subject of detailed analysis in the Haggadah shel Pessach. These events proved that G’d had chosen the Jewish people as His most treasured possession among the nations.', 'את כל התלאה אשר מצאתם בדרך, hunger, thirst, and the unprovoked attack by Amalek.', ""'ויצילם ה, this demonstrated G’d’s personal concern and involvement in the fate of the Jewish nation.

Exodus, 18,9,"['ויחד יתרו, he did not rejoice over the destruction of Egypt as a major power.

We know this from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.58.11"" data-ref=""Psalms 58:11"">Psalms 58,11</a>. However, he did rejoice over the well being of the Israelites.

Exodus, 18,11,"['כי בדבר אשר זדו עליהם. G’d saved the people by using the very means the Egyptians had used to harm them to harm their oppressors. The word זדו, past tense, occurs as future tense, יזיד in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.21.14"" data-ref=""Exodus 21:14"">Exodus 21,14</a> describing the deliberate commission of a crime, a sin.

(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.1.22"" data-ref=""Exodus 1:22"">Exodus 1,22</a>). The Egyptians died by drowning just as their victims the Jewish babies had died by drowning. Yitro recognised that the ability to make the punishment fit the crime is what put our G’d in a class all by Himself, unparalleled in any other religion. None of G’d’s agents in the celestial spheres, even, would be able to do this.']"
Exodus, 18,12,"['עולה וזבחים לאלוקים. This was intended as a symbol of Yitro’s acceptance of the yoke of Heaven. A similar symbolic acceptance is found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.5.17"" data-ref=""II Kings 5:17"">Kings II 5,17</a> when the general Naaman undertakes never again to offer such sacrifices as עולה וזבחים to any deities other than the G’d in heaven.', 'לאכול לחם עם חותן משה, to rejoice with him on his entry into the select circle of those who serve the only true G’d, the Creator of the universe.

Moses learned the Torah directly from G’d; when Aaron entered his tent he told him what he had learned. Aaron would move over and take his seat on Moses’ left. After that Aaron’s sons would enter and Moses would instruct them in what G’d had taught him. This continued until Moses had taught the same lesson no fewer than 4 times. We can see that all this took time, and as a result the ordinary people had to stand in line for a long time. \n']"
Exodus, 18,18,"['גם העם הזה אשר עמך, the member of your court.', 'לא תוכל עשוהו לבדך, you cannot all by yourself listen to the problems of all the leaders and subsequently to all the problems of the individuals who feel they need your personal attention, believing that no one but you can deal with their specific problems.']"

Initially a problem would be submitted to one of the 60000 men appointed as “chief” of ten. If such a man did not know the answer he would refer it to one of the 12000 chiefs of 50, and so on in an ascending order. The different levels of judges would in effect act as appellate judges, reviewing if judgments made by the lower ranking judges and appealed should be changed.']"
Exodus, 18,22,"['והקל מעליך, the many minor disputes which do not need to be adjudged by you, personally.', 'ונשאו אתך, they will give you the chance to give your full attention to those problems that are complicated by sharing the burden of leadership with you.

Exodus, 19,6,"['ואתם תהיו לי ממלכת כהנים, this will make you special for only you will be a kingdom of priests, by teaching and instructing all of mankind to call out in the name of G’d and for all to serve him together. This was to be a forerunner of what will happen in the distant future as predicted by the prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.61.6"" data-ref=""Isaiah 61:6"">Isaiah 61,6</a> “and you will be proclaimed ‘priests’ of the Lord.” This is also the true meaning of כי מציון תצא תורה, “the Torah emanates from Zion.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.2.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 2:3"">Isaiah 2,3</a>) [This statement is attributed to the nations of the world at that time.', 'וגוי קדוש, never to disappear from the stage of history. You will continue forever to exist as one man, as it will be in the distant future of which the prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.4.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 4:3"">Isaiah 4,3</a> said “those who survive in Zion and those who will be left over in Jerusalem, all those who are inscribed for life in Jerusalem- shall be called ‘holy’.” [the author is making the point that somebody called קדוש is by definition immortal. Ed.] Our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.92"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 92"">Sanhedrin 92</a> describe this concept in the following words: “just as He, the Holy One, is forever, so the Jewish people are forever.” It had been G’d’s intention to make the Jewish people immortal at the time of the revelation at Mount Sinai, giving them the status that Adam had enjoyed before he sinned. Alas, just as Adam had sinned and had become mortal in Gan Eden, the Jewish people sinned with the golden calf and suffered the same fate as first man. The disaster is documented in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:6"">Exodus 33,6</a> “the Children of Israel had to divest themselves of their jewelry which had been given them at Mount Chorev.”']"
Exodus, 19,8,"['וישב משה את דברי העם, Moses relayed to G’d what he had understood as being the people’s reactions. What he had understood was that they did not doubt his status as a prophet at all.']"
Exodus, 19,9,"['בעב הענן, even though all of Moses’ prophetic stature underwent a drastic change on the occasion of the revelation at Mount Sinai, and he now received “clear” messages, something described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.12.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 12:8"">Numbers 12,8</a> as ותמונת ה\' יביט, “he sees the message from G’d as a clear picture” (not merely as a reflection by a mirror) he was not to behold the Shechinah, but it was shrouded in thick cloud. The present communication with G’d which Moses used was not of the אספקלריא מאירה, “clear view” type.', 'בעבור ישמע העם וגם בך יאמינו לעולם, they will believe in the possibility of this “face to face” communication between man and G’d, and the fact that you have been granted this level of prophecy by Me. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.4"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:4"">Deut.5,4</a> concerning the expression “face to face.”) One of the principal ingredients of this level of prophecy is that the prophet remains in full control of all his faculties including all parts of his body, something no one had been able to credit until they saw that Moses possessed such a capability.The Israelites commented on this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.21"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:21"">Deuteronomy 5,21</a> when Moses quoted them as having said: “this day we have seen that G’d can speak directly to man and man can survive such an encounter.” [In other words, it took the revelation at Mount Sinai, experienced by all the people, to teach them that Moses could enjoy such a relationship with G’d on an ongoing basis. Ed.] It is not that the people needed convincing that there were people who enjoyed prophetic stature and communicated with G’d and He with them. After all, they knew about all the patriarchs, Aaron and Miriam as well as Moses being prophets. However, up until this time all prophetic messages from G’d had been communicated either in a dream or in a vision involving the prophet losing touch with his surroundings at the time of such communication by G’d. [at the very least, if such a communication had been received while the recipient was awake he would have to sit down, as he would be unable to stand. [Avraham’s being able to run to welcome the angels, (his vision) was a sign of a higher than usual level of prophecy. Ed.] Now, for the first time, did the people witness that the recipient of such communications need not necessarily have to temporarily forego being in touch with all that goes on in our terrestrial world. You will understand this better in light of how G’d Himself explained to Miriam and Aaron in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.12.7"" data-ref=""Numbers 12:7"">Numbers 12,7</a> the difference between their level of communication with G’d and that of their brother Moses, whom G’d described as thoroughly “at home” in all sections of “His house.” Only after having themselves experienced what this kind of prophetic level meant could they credit Moses as possessing it. Now they also understood that no other prophet, even a legitimate one, could challenge Moses, seeing that his stature as prophet was so superior to any other prophet.', '\'ויגד משה את דברי העם אל ה, when he heard that his Creator had told him that G’d wanted the people to have absolute faith in the supremacy of his prophecy, Moses understood suddenly that the people had entertained some doubts about the nature of his prophetical powers. He conveyed the people’s words to G’d to show that they had unreservedly undertaken to accept everything G’d wanted from them as conveyed to them from him as G’d’s word. He emphasized that the people had not only said: כן נעשה, “so we shall do,” but had said כל אשר דבר ה\' נעשה, “everything that G’d has said we shall do.” This was in fact a restrictive comment, meaning that if what they heard was G’d’s command they would do it, not if it was only the command of an angel. We know already from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:21"">Exodus 23,21</a> that an angel is not empowered to forgive any errors committed by the people, כי לא ישא לפשעכם, and therefore Moses himself rejected the idea that the people be under the protection of an angel instead of under G’d’s personal supervision. The people were aware of this distinction. This is why they had committed themselves to obey only commands issued by G’d directly.']"
Exodus, 19,11,"['והיו נכונים, that not only the mind, the spirit, be in readiness for the revelation but also the body that houses the spirit. This was necessary because the level of prophecy they would experience at the revelation would far surpass anything an ordinary prophet experiences, something for which he does not have to prepare his body by ritual immersion, and loss of any residue of seminal fluids the body ejaculated during the days immediately preceding the prophetic vision. Moses was not forbidden physical contact with his own wife until he had attained this level of prophetic stature. This would commence from the time of the revelation and onwards. At that time he released the other Israelites from the restriction of carrying on marital relations with their wives by saying to them: “return to your tents” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.5.27-28"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 5:27-28"">Deuteronomy 5,27-28</a>). Moses himself had been told by G’d at that time: “you remain standing here with Me.” This is what our sages explained in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.87"" data-ref=""Shabbat 87"">Shabbat 87</a>.']"
Exodus, 19,12,"['כל הנוגע בהר מות ימות, a warning to deter the people from being harmed in the event they would trample the boundary markers around the mountain in their eagerness to catch a glimpse of G’d. Such people, if they were to become victims of their own folly, would mar the entire joyful experience of the giving of the Torah by defiling the earth around them with their carcasses. They would cause their relatives to become mourners on what should have been the most auspicious experience of their lives. The presence of G’d, the Shechinah, does not manifest itself to people in mourning.']"
Exodus, 19,16,"['ויהי קולות וברקים.

Exodus, 19,21,"['רד העד בעם פן יהרסו, when I will be speaking to them.

Exodus, 20,3,"['לא יהיה לך אלוהים, even though you accepted My Kingdom, you must not at the same time also attribute divine qualities to any other servant of Mine.

These people are reported as “worshipping the G’d of Israel (as they now were within what they considered to be His domain.) But at the same time they also worshipped other deities. The priest sent by the king of Assyria to teach these Samarians the Jewish religion considered their worshipping the G’d of Israel as quite useless. He told them that unless they worshipped the G’d of Israel exclusively they would likely continue to suffer the incursions of lions, etc. ', 'על פני.

I am therefore entitled to stand on My dignity by refusing to be compared.', 'פוקד עון אבות, the reason why I sometimes wait so long before punishing some of the wicked in this life is that by waiting and noticing that their offspring, i.e. second and third generation continue in their wicked ways their measure of guilt will become so full that I will exterminate that whole family from life in this world. [this is what happened to the family of Jerobam for instance, and that of Omri, his son Achav, etc. ] This was possible only by adding the unrequited sins of the fathers to those of the sons, or even subsequent generations, so that when finally, retribution did come, it wiped out the family completely. This happened in the third generation of the original sinner such as Omri’s grandchildren. It also happened to the fourth generation after Yehu (who himself had been G’d’s instrument for wiping out the family of Omri/Achav) when his great grandson Zecharyah was murdered after reigning only 6 months. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.15.9"" data-ref=""II Kings 15:9"">Kings II 15,9</a>) We know about this method G’d employs sometimes already since <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.15"" data-ref=""Genesis 15"">Genesis chapter 15</a> when G’d explained to Avraham that his descendants could not expect to take possession of the land of Canaan until the fourth generation, as the sins of the Emorite would not be irrevocable until then.

Exodus, 20,6,"['ועושה חסד לאלפים, on other occasions the reason why retribution is so long delayed is due to the good deeds of someone’s forbears which I have sworn to requite by extending such patience in tolerating the errors of their offspring.

It is not compatible with G’d’s honour and dignity that man use His Holy name for his own ends. The only time such an oath is permissible, or in some instances even mandatory, is when it is impossible to arrive at the truth by any other means there being no witnesses to the matter under dispute.

Exodus, 21,13,"['והאלוקים אנה לידו, this was not a death caused intentionally by the killer, but we know that there operates a principle in this world known as מגלגלין חובה על ידי חייב, “G’d arranges matters so that the guilty party being punished will be punished by someone himself guilty of something else.” This is what Solomon referred to in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.16.4"" data-ref=""Proverbs 16:4"">Proverbs 16,4</a> וגם רשע ליום רעה, “even the wicked for the day of evil.” [to the question if everything has a purpose in this world, what is the function of the wicked?

Exodus, 21,24,"['עין תחת עין; this is what ought to be the judgment against the offender, if we were to apply the principle of the punishment fitting the crime in all its severity. However, according to tradition only financial compensation is exacted as we cannot accurately measure how to apply the principle of “an eye for an eye” literally.']"

Exodus, 22,2,"['ונמכר בגנבתו, if the Torah had not legislated this form of paying off one’s debt for theft most of the poor people of the nation would become thieves, knowing that they did not have to make restitution except with liquid assets.

Exodus, 22,4,"['כי יבער איש שדה או כרם, within his own property, (originally)', 'ובער בשדה אחר, even if the animal had wandered off into someone else’s field without encouragement by its owner,', 'מיטב שדהו ומיטב כרמו ישלם, the quality of the restitution must consist of the best of the field or vineyard, seeing that animals wandering off to feed elsewhere is such a widespread phenomenon.

Exodus, 22,6,"['כסף או כלים, examples of the items most commonly entrusted to one’s neighbour for safekeeping during the owner’s absence from his home. These are looked after on a reciprocal basis, no fee being charged for this service.']"

Exodus, 22,8,"['אשר יאמר כי הוא זה, also if the accused says “this is the truth,” implying that only part of the accusation is true.

It does not matter whether the subject matter under dispute is a loan and whether it has been repaid, or something entrusted for safekeeping; in either case the claim being admitted partially.', 'אשר ירשיעון אלוהים ישלם שנים, when the judges convict the guilty party this is equivalent to a conviction for theft, and the penalty is restitution of twice the amount under dispute. A false claim that something had been stolen is equivalent to the person making the claim being judged a thief.\n']"
Exodus, 22,9,"['חמור או שור או שה, under normal circumstances the poor people assume guardianship of such animals against payment of a fee.']"
Exodus, 22,12,"['יביאהו עד, we already explained that whenever the Torah uses the word עד in the singular mode what is meant are two witnesses who are acceptable to the court. אם טרוף יטרף, by some wild beast; presumably someone did witness the occurrence seeing there must have been other shepherds in the vicinity. What kind of testimony is expected of these witnesses?', 'הטרפה, that the situation in which the animal had been mauled or eaten was the kind of accident which the shepherd guarding it could not have been prevented by exercising greater care.', 'לא ישלם, the shepherd does not have to make restitution. If, however, the predators had eaten the animal under discussion due to insufficient supervision on the part of the shepherd, the shepherd has to make restitution. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bava_Metzia.93"" data-ref=""Bava Metzia 93"">Baba Metzia 93</a>) In determining a reasonable fight which the shepherd has to put up against predators, Rashi quoting the Mechilta says that a solitary wolf is not something against which the shepherd is defenseless, neither are two dogs. Naturally, smaller animals and rodents are not considered as posing a threat to man.']"
Exodus, 22,14,"['אם בעליו עמו, during the time the animal performs the work for which it has been loaned out.', 'לא ישלם, the borrower. The reason is that under most circumstances, the animal has been loaned after both parties had agreed what kind of work it would be used for. Its status therefore is similar to that of a gift on the understanding that it would be returned. When one makes this kind of gift one does not draw up a list of conditions pertaining to the precise use the gift may be made of. If such a list of conditions had indeed been drawn up the nature of the entire transaction would have been nullified, it would no longer be classified as a temporary gift at all, but the owner would remain effectively the owner, so that non return, even deliberately, would not constitute a dereliction resulting in his being entitled to compensation from the “borrower.” The presence of the owner during any accident which had befallen the loaned animal is taken by the Torah as proof that he had never relinquished any part of his ownership, hence he is not entitled to compensation. One does not get compensation for losing what belongs to one. ']"
Exodus, 22,19,"['זובח לאלוהים, to all the deities simultaneously. This is forbidden even though the worshipper includes Hashem in the address to which the sacrifice is tendered.', 'יחרם, the person will be executed and the offering itself is prohibited for any use whatsoever. Just as the false deities are to be banished totally, so those who believe in them.

Exodus, 22,21,"['לא תענון אם ענה תענה אותו; if, in the process of oppressing an orphan your intention was only to oppress him alone; if your “oppressing” him was in the nature of disciplining him in order to ultimately bestowing loving kindness on him after he responded to your rebuking him, your disciplining him is considered an act of loving kindness. [the author interprets verse 22 starting with the word אם as an alternative, moderating what has been written in verse 21. Ed.]']"
Exodus, 22,23,['שמוע אשמע צעקתו וחרה אפי. I will have pity with the one who cries out to Me complaining against the harsh and unfair treatment he has to endure. G’d’s reaction to a Jewish individual guilty of such behaviour will be similar to His reaction to the prolonged abuse suffered by the Israelites at the hands of the Egyptians. Anyone guilty of such oppression of orphans or widows will bring about this kind of suffering for his own family members.']
Exodus, 22,24,"['אם כסף תלוה, if this is an Israelite on whom the promise that “there will not be a destitute person among you” has not been fulfilled. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.15.4"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 15:4"">Deuteronomy 15,4</a>) The individual in need of a loan is the one who became subject to another promise (threat) written in the Torah in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.15.11"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 15:11"">Deuteronomy 15,11</a> כי לא יחדל אביון, “there will never be a total absence of destitute people, etc.” When such a situation arises the victim will require a loan.']"
Exodus, 22,26,"['ושמעתי כי חנון אני, even though the debtor cannot complain to Me about you, seeing he owes you repayment for a loan, if he nonetheless cries out to Me complaining about his economic situation which causes him to be practically naked seeing you took his clothing as security for his overdue loan, I will give him part of what I had intended to give you as recognition of your supplying his needs. If you had been granted more financial means than you needed, the only reason was so that you could use your excess to assist the needy.', 'כי חנון אני, I will therefore display My compassion for anyone who has no one else to turn to. It is in your own interest then to demonstrate your compassion by returning his pledge to him when he is in need of it. If you will do this you will ensure that I will not withdraw My compassion from you. This, in turn, will enable you to extend loans to other needy people.']"
Exodus, 22,27,"['אלוהים לא תקלל, even though you may feel that the judge has judged you unfairly, you must not curse him. The reason is that no individual can judge his own guilt or innocence objectively.', 'ונשיא בעמך לא תאור, cursing the legitimate authority of a country, its official rulers, will frequently result in the whole population experiencing the negative fallout of such curses. Compare what Solomon has to say on this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.24.21"" data-ref=""Proverbs 24:21"">Proverbs 24,21</a> “fear the Lord my son, and the king; do not associate with those who keep changing.” [the author appears to read into above verse that hereditary royalty is to be obeyed in preference to elected rulers who are elected only for a limited period of time, and can be replaced by the will of the people even during their term of office.

Exodus, 22,28,"['מלאתך, the heave for the priest of your grain harvest.

This includes service in the Temple, teaching Torah, something which in later periods became the foremost occupation of the priests, commented upon by Maleachi 2,7 with the line כי שפתי כהן ישמרו דעת והתורה יבקשו מפיהו, “for the lips of a priest guard knowledge, and men seeking rulings from his mouth, for he is a messenger of the Lord of Hosts.”']"
Exodus, 22,29,"['כן תעשה לשורך לצאנך, that you shall give to Me the firstborn which is not a prematurely aborted fetus.

In the case of animals the parallel period is eight days.”']"
Exodus, 22,30,"['ואנשי קודש תהיון לי, the manner in which you will prove that you all are men of holy purpose is that you will allow your firstborns to be devoted to the service of Me and you will hand over the tithes, etc., stipulated as “My gifts,” [in matters of specific ritual, seeing that every Jew has to serve Hashem. Ed.]  Initially, it was the task of the firstborn to teach the common people the details of Jewish law and ritual.

The result might be that the judge will confiscate money from the defendant based on a document with only one signature, something inadmissible under Jewish law. ']"
Exodus, 23,2,"['לא תהיה אחרי רבים לרעות, as the tie-breaking vote in a trial involving capital punishment. One cannot declare someone guilty of the death penalty on the basis of a solitary judge. A majority of one would be equivalent to a conviction by a single judge.', 'ולא תענה על ריב, when your colleagues the other judges ask your opinion,', 'לנטות אחרי רבים, do not be influenced by the fact that the majority thinks differently from you. Assuming that in a trial 10 of the 23 judges had expressed the view that the accused was innocent whereas eleven had expressed the view that the accused was guilty, ', 'להטות, if you were to cast your vote with the majority there would then be a majority of 2 out of a total of 23 voting guilty, and that decision would have been arrived at by your single vote. You are not allowed to salvage your conscience by voting with the majority unless this represented your absolute conviction. You must explain the reason for your vote. Unless there is a majority of two votes in favour of guilty no one can be convicted of the death penalty. ']"
Exodus, 23,6,"['לא תטה משפט אביונך בריבו, an example of being lenient with one category of person and harsh with another. When litigants are facing you, you must not take account of any differences in their social standing.

Exodus, 23,7,"['מדבר שקר תרחק, the Torah addresses the judge, telling him to stay clear of anything which could create the impression that he has dealings with something corrupt.

The Talmud bases this on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.58.13"" data-ref=""Isaiah 58:13"">Isaiah 58,13</a> who defines proper Sabbath observance as distinct from merely formal Sabbath observance, with these words: “if you refrain from trampling the Sabbath, from pursuing your affairs on My holy day; if you call the Sabbath ‘delight,’ the Lord’s holy day ‘honored,’ and if you honour it and go not your ways nor look to your affairs nor strike bargains, then you can seek the favour of the Lord.”', 'למען ינוח שורך וחמורך, as a result of your Sabbath observance also your beasts of burden will enjoy rest.', 'וינפש בן אמתך והגר, as a corollary of your own Sabbath observance also your personnel will enjoy physical respite from their weekday chores.

Exodus, 23,13,"['כל אשר אמרתי אליכם תשמרו, ושם אלוהימ אחרים לא תזכירו, the Israelites are cautioned not only not to violate G’d’s commandments, but to construct safeguards to ensure that they do not violate these commandments inadvertently. A prime example of this is the caution not to only not to worship idols, but not even to mention their names.', 'לא ישמע על פיך, you must not even be the cause of others mentioning the names of these idols.

Exodus, 23,16,['בצאת השנה. After all the harvests have been gathered in.']
Exodus, 23,17,"['שלש פעמים בשנה יראה, to give thanks to the Lord for the attainment of freedom from bondage, in spring, in summer and in fall. All our achievements stem from Him.', 'אל פני האדון, to appear in the presence of the אדון. The term אדון is applied to someone who is in control of perishable things, mortals, etc. The Torah, by using this name of G’d, reminds us that He is the master of the people who present themselves each as an individual. When they make such an appearance before the Lord, they are as if each making an obeisance before his Master. This “Master” is simultaneously the master of the soil they toil which provides their livelihood, seeing that G’d is on record as כי לי כל הארץ כי גרים ותושבים אתם עמדי, “all of the earth is Mine for you are strangers or at best resident strangers with Me.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.25.23"" data-ref=""Leviticus 25:23"">Leviticus 25,23</a>).

Exodus, 23,22,"['כי אם שמוע תשמע בקולו...ואיבתי את אויביך, My relationship to you then will not be protective, defensive, i.e. that I need to protect you, but aggressive, by treating your enemies as My enemies.

However, ואל משה אמר, to Moses himself G’d had said that he should come up to the mountain just as he had been commanded to do already before the revelation, when G’d had said to him in 19,14 לך רד ועלית אתה ואהרן עמך.\n']"

It is the essence of what we consider the celestial regions, “heaven,” for lack of a better word. It is not connected to the solid physical planets etc., which form the “inhabitants” of these celestial domains.

Exodus, 24,11,"['ואל אצילי בני ישראל לא שלח ידו,  G’d, did not extend His helping hand to enable these nobles and elders to grant them the level of prophetic status while they were oblivious to their five senses with which they perceived while merely human beings. We encounter such a concept in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.8.1"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 8:1"">Ezekiel 8,1</a> when the prophet describes an inspiration received with the words: ותפול עלי יד ה\', “and the “hand” of G’d “fell” upon me there.” The use of this phraseology describes the separation of the “normal” senses used for perception employed by the prophet, and his transformation into a super terrestrial dimension. [It is probably impossible to really “translate” this line into the vernacular in any language. The main point our author makes, as opposed to other commentators, is that this “hand of G’d” is not perceived by him as one that is retributive in character, but, on the contrary, as one that elevates the human being to a spiritually higher dimension.” In our context the Torah says that the “visions” achieved by these אצילי בני ישראל, were not further helped along by G’d. Ed.] Examples of people who divest themselves of human senses, or human garb, (a simile for their senses?) are King Saul in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.19.24"" data-ref=""I Samuel 19:24"">Samuel I 19,24</a>  “then he too stripped off his clothes and he too spoke in ecstasy before Samuel, and he lay naked all day and night.

They prepared this festive meal congratulating themselves on a higher spiritual dimension which they felt they had achieved.\n']"
Exodus, 24,12,"[""עלה אלי ההרה, to the top of the mountain. This was after he had already approached more closely than the people with him, as we have read in verse 2, ונגש משה לבדו “only Moses alone is to approach any closer.” Nonetheless, at that point he had not ascended the summit of the mountain. It was on this occasion, while they looked after Moses disappearing into the cloud forming a shroud around the mountain, that the “nobles” and the elders had the vision just described. This is what was meant in verse 17 with the words ומראה כבוד ה' כאש אוכלת בראש ההר, “and the manifestation of the glory of the Lord was similar to a consuming fire at the top of the mountain.” We find this formulation (ראש ההר) again during the giving of the Ten Commandments in 19,20."", 'והיה שם, stay there for an extended period. The root היה appears in this sense in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.10.5"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 10:5"">Deuteronomy 10,5</a> ויהיו שם כאשר צוני, “they have remained there as G’d had commanded me.”', 'והתורה, “and the part which requires profound study,”', 'והמצוה, and the part of the Torah which primarily requires action in order to fulfill it.', 'אשר כתבתי, “which I (the Lord) have written.” If it had not been for the sin of the golden calf, the entire Torah would have been handed to the Jewish people (Moses) as a signed and sealed document just like the Tablets with the Ten Commandments. Moses alluded to this when he described the approach of G’d to Mount Sinai in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.33.2"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 33:2"">Deuteronomy 33,2</a> ואתה מרבבות קודש מימינו אש דת למו , G’d was ready to hand us the whole Torah but the sin of the golden calf prevented this at that that time. Instead, Moses wrote down the Torah at G’d’s command (dictation). Moses is on record as having done this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.34.27"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 34:27"">Deuteronomy 34,27</a>. In fact, Moses only brought the Tablets to within sight of the people in order to smash them before their eyes, so that they would understand what they had forfeited due to their disloyalty to G’d. This demonstration of Moses having smashed the Tablets was designed to shock the people into penitence.', 'להורותם, to teach them.

Knowing this, a statement by the sages which appears to conflict with the statement we quoted from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Gittin.60"" data-ref=""Gittin 60"">Gittin 60</a>, and which states that most of the legislation of the Torah is derived from the “oral Torah,” is not in conflict with that at all.

Exodus, 24,14,"['ואל הזקנים אמר, when he departed from them in order to ascend to the top of the mountain as G’d had commanded him in verse 12.']"
Exodus, 24,18,"['ויהי משה בהר, each time Moses ascended the mountain from this point on he remained on it for a period of 40 days and forty nights. This period corresponds to the time it takes for a fertilised egg in a woman’s womb to achieve a critical status that permits us to refer to it as a fetus. Moses’ stay on the mountain for such periods of time effected his spiritual progress in a similar manner, elevating him to higher spiritual dimensions. The evidence lies in the fact that eventually Moses’ face radiated so much spiritual  illumination that the people were frightened by this phenomenon and Moses had to veil his head. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.29"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:29"">Exodus 34,29</a>) Moses had been meant to achieve this stature already at the end of his first 40 days’ stay on the mountain, but the people’s making the golden calf and worshipping it, foiled this plan. G’d Himself told Moses to descend due to his people having become corrupt (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:7"">Exodus 32,7</a>). According to our tradition, Moses’ second stay of forty days on the mountain was a period when G’d’s anger at the people had not yet abated, so that he could not be rewarded with the distinction G’d had in mind for him. He attained that distinction only during his third stay on the mountain when he was also instructed concerning the construction of the Tabernacle seeing that he was told to place the second set of Tablets in the Holy Ark (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.25.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 25:21"">Exodus 25,21</a>). This did not refer to an ark within which to place the shattered first set of Tablets. In fact, according to tradition, seeing that the letters written by G’d on the first set of Tablets had “flown” away, the remnants of those Tablets which were eventually placed in another ark are not referred to as “The testimony,” seeing they did not contain any writing anymore at that point. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Pesachim.87"" data-ref=""Pesachim 87"">Pesachim 87</a>) Commencing with 25,8 where G’d says to Moses that He will take up permanent residence in the Tabernacle to be built, the first 2500 years of mankind’s history where G’d was equally accessible anywhere has come to an end, and there would be a centralised form of worship as part of the Jewish religion. Instead of G’d permitting the erection of altars anywhere it pleased man, and His coming to meet man at such sites, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.20"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:20"">Exodus 20,20</a>) now the roles are reversed and He will be in residence in His palace on earth, and anyone who wishes to pray to Him effectively will have to do this at that Temple. There will be groups of people charged with the sacrificial service in the Temple, the priests, and laymen will not be allowed into the inner sanctum of this Temple at all. This, in short, is the message of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.28.1"" data-ref=""Exodus 28:1"">Exodus 28,1</a> “and you (Moses) bring close (To Me) your brother Aaron.” Actually, the tribe of Levi had not yet been selected until after the affair of the golden calf. Moses recalls that event in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.10.8"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 10:8"">Deuteronomy 10,8</a> and the events that had led up to it. In light of all this the fact that Moses spent 40 days and nights on the mountain each time he ascended there is very significant. The stage at which Moses‘ face radiated these rays of light was not achieved until the end of Moses’ third stay on the mountain after he had been commanded to erect the Tabernacle. After the building of the Tabernacle had been completed,  as well as the making of the priestly garments, and the incense and oil anointing, Moses revealed the stages that preceded it, telling the people that at the end of the first forty days on the mountains he received the first set of Tablets. Any delay in the carrying out of G’d’s original timetable for these events was not due to G’d delaying His plan but to the conduct of the people in the interval that had forced Him to revise His timetable. Had the episode of the golden calf not intervened, Moses’ second and third stay on the mountain would have been totally superfluous. The episodes described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:7"">Exodus 32,7</a>, 33,12 and 34,1 until 34 28-29 were only caused by the repercussions of the sin of the golden calf.\n']"
Exodus, 25,2,"['דבר אל בני ישראל ויקחו לי תרומה, tell the stewards of Israel that I desire that they should collect a contribution for Me. [the Torah had not specified “who” should take. Ed.] Moses also issued such instructions on his return from the mountain the third time as the Torah reports (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.32"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:32"">Exodus 34,32</a>) ואחרי כן נגשו כל בני ישראל, ויצום את כל אשר דבר ה\' אתו בהר סיני, “after that all the people of Israel drew near, and he commanded them all that the Lord had talked about with him on Mount Sinai.” This was followed by ויאמר משה אל כל עדת בני ישראל קחו מאתכם תרומה in 35,4. The עדת בני ישראל who were to carry out this “taking (accepting) of the gifts were the Sanhedrin, the High Court. The Israelites were so anxious to contribute that they did not wait until the High Court organised all this, but they approached Moses personally bringing with them so many contributions that Moses was forced to call a halt to this (36,5). This was also the reason that there was nothing left for the princes of Israel (the tribal chiefs) to contribute other than the gemstones for Aaron’s breastplate and the various oils making up the “oil of anointing.”', 'מאת כל איש, G’d commanded that the procedure should not be like the imposition of every man’s contribution for the public charity fund which was treated as a tax. Contributions were to be accepted only from volunteers.\n']"
Exodus, 25,3,"['וזאת התרומה, the word זאת means that no substitutes for the materials listed would be acceptable, such as perishables, for instance. Even the kind of gemstones (pearls, for instance) not usable for Aaron’s breastplate, were not accepted. The only type of contributions that were accepted were those that in themselves would be usable in the construction of the Tabernacle and its paraphernalia.']"
Exodus, 25,8,"['\'ושכנתי בתוכם ככל אשר אני מראה אותך וגו, “I will dwell among them permanently in order to receive their prayers and their sacrificial offerings in a manner similar to the way I displayed My presence at the mountain.” Henceforth My presence will be manifest between the two cherubs on the lid of the Holy Ark as part of the overall structure called the Tabernacle. [I will paraphrase from here on in. Ed.]The author perceives of different degrees of holiness, just as the kabbalists perceive holiness in the extra terrestrial world as consisting of spiritually progressively higher different levels. The outer structure known as תבנית המקדש, “the format,” visual image, lead up to the cherubs in the innermost part of that structure. The very concept of the Tabernacle leads the intelligent viewer to conclude that hidden deep within it, G’d’s presence, שכינה must be manifest. The prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.6.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 6:2"">Isaiah 6,2</a> phrased this as the שרפים עומדין ממעל לו, the types of angels of a rank known as “Seraphim” were in attendance above G’d’s throne. This was the closest to G’d’s essence that the prophets were shown in their visions. The terrestrial Tabernacle, if viewed as parallel to G’d’s throne in the celestial domains, contained different sections of progressively higher levels of sanctity which progressively restricted the type of people allowed to approach those levels. The Torah itself, for which the Holy Ark served as repository, was in an ark constructed of wood but overlaid with gold on the inside and on the outside, to reflect the saying of our sages in Yuma 72 that every Torah scholar whose external appearance did not reflect his internal stature is not a Torah scholar at all. The levels of sanctity in the Tabernacle, beginning already with the courtyard around it, were not sealed off from one another, but, on the contrary, were connected to one another all the way to the innermost sanctuary to demonstrate that sanctity is attainable progressively. On top of the physical box containing the spiritual teaching, the Torah, there was placed a lid also made from pure gold which symbolised the image of G’d. [in the sense that man was created in the image of G.d.] This lid was not linked, attached, to the ark itself at all. The detached nature of this “lid, כפורת,” symbolised that at a certain level of holiness there is no longer a physical bond with the human body, with the terrestrial domain, a domain which is essentially mortal, i.e. requiring regeneration from time to time. The description of the cherubs on top of the כפורת facing each other (verse 20) symbolises the interaction of the spiritual message contained in the Torah and its transmission to the human being studying it. The cherubs themselves are described as facing the lid, i.e. facing the Torah that is beneath that lid. As a result of such an attitude to Torah, i.e. looking to it for inspiration, the cherubs are then described as spreading their wings in an upward direction, as if reflecting that they had received spiritual inspiration enabling them to fly. This description of the cherubs’ posture reflects what Solomon described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.15.24"" data-ref=""Proverbs 15:24"">Proverbs 15,24</a> אורח חיים למעלה למשכיל, “for an intelligent man the path of life is upward.” As a result of our relating to Torah in the manner described, we will merit what <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:2"">Isaiah 66,2</a> describes as ואל זה אביט, when he refers to the prerequisite character traits necessary to merit Divine inspiration.', '<b>And so should you make [it].</b> Hashem’s presence would dwell among them only by means of the Tabernacle. This was a step down from what He had promised them before the sin of the Calf, “In <i>every</i> place that I permit My Name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you” (20:21).']"
Exodus, 25,12,"['פעמותיו, the corners at its outer edges.', 'ושתי טבעות על צלעו האחת, the side, wall of the Ark, is called צלע. G’d had commanded therefore that these rings be attached at the four corners of the Ark. G’d therefore commanded that there were to be four such rings at the four corners. Furthermore, G’d commanded that they not be attached along the short sides of the Ark but along the long sides of the ark. [this contradicts the commentary of both Rashi  and Rash’bam. Ed.]\n']"
Exodus, 25,16,"['ונתת אל הארון, the details were spelled out seeing this vessel had nothing to do with, and would not have been suitable for, sacrificial service.']"
Exodus, 25,20,"['והיו הכרובים, our prophets have already explained to us that when they had visions involving angels, such angels appeared to them in the guise of cherubs. This means that they had faces like humans but were equipped with wings. In spite of appearing as if physical beings, the fact that they represented disembodied intelligence was indicated by the fact that their motion was ever upwards when the prophet observed them as if being in motion. In other words, any motion ascribed to them was in the direction of facing towards G’d exclusively. Each one of these cherubs, whenever and to whomsoever they appeared, did so according to his respective level, rank, in the celestial hierarchy. והיו הכרובים פורשי כנפים, the cherubs were always in a posture of having extended wings. The human intelligence is one that aspires to attain union with its counterpart (the source from which it is derived). The process leading to this involves the understanding of certain mental disciplines in which the owner of this intelligence divests himself of any and all consideration involving concretization, i.e. concepts involving the material universe. Only in this manner can a human being attain the kind of understanding of the Divine that he is willing and capable of attaining, each according to the level of his intelligence and his piety. Such insights are achieved by intelligently looking at the manifestations of G’d in this world, studying about His attributes by gaining knowledge about how and when He does intervene in history by overriding the laws of nature which He Himself formulated and instituted. Knowing under what circumstances G’d will resort to such extraordinary miracles, and appreciating the rationale behind it, is what enables the prophet at certain times to evoke G’d’s direct involvement in the fates of individuals. When Moses asked G’d הןדיעני נא את דרכך, “please instruct me in Your ways,” (33,13) he wanted precisely these kinds of guidelines. When the Torah describes the cherubs as פורשי כנפים למעלה, this describes the source from which all this inspiration has to come. The sages already explained that these cherubs had the faces of a young boy and a young girl, (Yuma 54) a reference to the initiation of actions originating in a domain which is part of the abstract world. What is initiated there resembles something masculine, as the male is symbolic of initiating matters whereas the female’s role is more responsive in nature. ופניהם איש אל אחיו, this describes that what is initiated in abstract, disembodied regions of the universe, i.e. in heaven, is accepted, received willingly and in a complementary fashion by the creatures in this concrete, i.e. physical part of the universe, Only by a merging of these two basic constituent parts of our universe can “perfection” on earth be attained. The reason why the Torah continues in describing these cherubs as facing the lid of the Ark, i.e. looking downwards whereas their wings are spread upwards, is a reminder that although inspiration originates in heaven, understanding of G’d and how He works can only come by paying close attention and studying what He does in our material, “lower” part of His universe. The ideal means of unraveling the meaning of G’d’s actions is through His revealed word, the Torah, of which the Ark has become the repository. The upshot of the message contained in the symbolism represented by the cherubs, their shape, their posture, etc., is that for us on earth the key to obtain all these insights must be obtained by study of the Torah. By giving us the Torah, allowing us to build the Tabernacle, etc.,']"
Exodus, 25,22,"['ונועדתי לך שם ודברתי אתך, G’d assures Moses that this is the site where He will communicate with him and become as familiar to him as it is possible for G’d to become familiar to man. This is where the Shechinah’s presence will become “stationed,” as already spelled out in the opening verses of our chapter (8-9) with the words ושכנתי בתוכם ככל אשר אני מראה אותך, “I will dwell among them in accordance with the blueprint which I have shown you.” The meaning of the words וכן תעשו at the end of verse 9, is that once the Jewish people or their elite engage in study of the relationship of physics to metaphysics, something known in the parlance of the Talmud as מעשה מרכבה, and they will do so motivated by the acceptable purpose, i.e. to become better servants of the Lord, not only will the Shechinah assist us but the ministering angels will also be of help in furthering such study. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Chagigah.14"" data-ref=""Chagigah 14"">Chagigah 14</a>)\n']"
Exodus, 25,23,"['ועשית שלחן, after the Ark, which symbolised G’d’s throne on earth, as expressed by the words ונועדתי לך שם, “I will designate this for My meeting place with you,” (verse 22) had been completed, G’d commanded the construction of the Table and the Lamp stand, essential furnishings for a guest room, as we know from King II 4,10 where the lady in Shunem, planning to provide private accommodation for the prophet Elisha who was her frequent guest, discusses such details with her husband. According to our sages in Yuma 72 the crown-like border surrounding the surface of the table symbolised the crown of the kingdom of G’d. A king’s task in administering the affairs of state is divided into two aspects. 1) He must dispense justice, or appoint people who see to it that justice is dispensed. 2) He must concern himself with the defense of the realm, again, either personally, or by delegating his authority to loyal experts. This is how the people requesting that Samuel appoint a king for them defined the king’s duties in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.8.20"" data-ref=""I Samuel 8:20"">Samuel I 8,20</a>. Accordingly, the table actually had two “crowns.” (this exegesis differs from that of Rashi who holds that there was only one such “crown.”) One of the “crowns” is for the table as such, the table symbolising the physical nourishment of the people and the general  conduct of its affairs, the second symbolises an “enclosure, security fence,” מסגרת, a defensive system against harm to the people from whatever source, signaling that any attacker will not only be repelled but will be crushed.']"
Exodus, 25,29,"['קערותיו וכפותיו, these vessels were popularly used at Royal banquets, etc.']"
Exodus, 25,31,"['ועשית מנורת זהב טהור. This commandment follows the establishment of “2 crowns,” the crown of Torah as represented by the Ark, and the crown of Royalty as represented by the Table. The Torah arranged the subject of the Menorah as something that it totally integrated, i.e. just as the Menorah was to be constructed of a single chunk of gold, not as a composite structure, so the seven lights were also to be arranged in such a way that the light from the lamps would converge in one above the light burning on top of the central shaft. This is the meaning of the words והאיר על עבר פניה, (verse 36) this means that the lights both on the right of the center shaft and those on the left should be arranged so that the respective flames would focus in the direction of the middle. Inasmuch as the lights symbolised spiritual “enlighten-ment,” the lesson is that in all our efforts at obtaining such enlightenment, and during all the digressions that the pursuit of such disciplines necessarily entails, we must never lose sight of the direction in which we are striving and keep this central idea of such enlightenment resulting in us becoming better servants of the Lord, constantly in front of our mental eye. The reason that there were lights on both the right side of the center shaft as well as on the left side, is that pursuit of enlightenment expresses itself both in gaining of theoretical knowledge, ethical imperatives, but no less so in the practical application of such lessons learned. Both must be placed in the service of the נר המערבי, the light from the center shaft, the one which faces the Shechinah directly.

Exodus, 26,1,"['ואת המשכן תעשה, the reason why these curtains are referred to by the Torah as משכן, “a residence,” is because in the space covered by them there were the kinds of furnishings normally found in a dwelling, i.e. table, cupboard (Ark), and a lamp stand. The dwelling was designed to house the presence of G’d more commonly referred to as the Shechinah. כרובים, the curtains were made with the patterns of cherubs woven into them, as we know from the description of Isaiah’s vision (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.6.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 6:2"">Isaiah 6,2</a>) that he perceived G’d surrounded by angels described as Seraphim.

The difference alluded to the different degree of sanctity of these two sections of the Tabernacle. [I do not know the author’s source for this assertion.

Exodus, 26,7,"['לאהל על המשכן. The purpose of what was called משכן had not been to serve as a tent, but to assure that the cherubs would be surrounding the Shechinah.']"
Exodus, 26,9,"['וחברת את חמש היריעות לבד, even within the Tabernacle there was a difference between levels of sanctity.

Exodus, 27,20,"['ואתה תצוה, If, prior to this admonition, the Torah introduced its instructions with the words ועשית, “you will do, etc.,” the meaning had been that Moses was not to do this personally, but that he was to delegate the tasks in question. The formulation ואתה, however, means: “and you personally.” He, personally, was to issue instructions to the Israelites concerning providing the oil for the Menorah. He, personally, was to assemble Aaron and his sons and to address all the חכמי לב, “wise-hearted people.” (28,1 and 28,3)', 'ויקחו אליך, as the need would arise in the future, after the Tabernacle had been completed.

Exodus, 28,21,"['והאבנים תהיין על שמות בני ישראל, as soon as the Israelites when donating these various materials had dedicated them to their sacred purpose, i.e. that their names be inscribed on these gemstones, they became sacred, so that the word תהיין, meaning “they will remain, etc.,” is fully justified.”', 'שתים עשרה על שמותם, the Torah emphasises that the number 12 is not arbitrary but represents the names of the 12 tribes, no fewer nor any additional ones. [Joseph is represented by one gemstone not two, and the tribe of Levi was included though they did not share in the distribution of the land of Canaan to the tribes.

Exodus, 29,22,"['כי איל מלואים הוא, this was the reason that the right thigh was burned on the altar. This practice did not apply to any of the other animal sacrifices. [with the exception of burnt-offerings which were burned up completely. Ed.] The Torah views the right thigh of the animal as equivalent to the right hand of a human being. Wherever in the Torah the word אצבע appears in the same context as the priesthood, the reference is to the finger of the right hand. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Menachot.10"" data-ref=""Menachot 10"">Menachot 10</a>).']"
Exodus, 29,24,"['והנפת, this “waving” applies to the part of the sacrificial animal that the priests are given to eat. The main reason is that the priest should remain aware that he eats from שלחן גבוה, “from G’d’s table,” so to speak, i.e. that his portions are a “kick back,” totally voluntary gift from G’d, and that he does not eat by “rights,” i.e. that this is what the owner of the sacrificial animal designated for him. In this instance, also the part of the animal which would normally be his to eat wound up on the altar instead of being consumed by the priests, it being an introductory symbolic procedure. [perhaps similar to the concept of ראשית, the “first” part of crops which need to be consecrated to G’d of produce originating from the earth. Ed.]']"

Exodus, 30,1,"['מזבח מקטר קטורת, he will put only a minimal amount of fire on that altar in order to burn the incense thereon. This altar did not have to be hollow, filled with earth, as was the copper altar which was filled with earth in order that the supply of fire be on the earth, literally. On this altar the fire was kept on the gold overlay. Seeing that there was only a minimal amount of fire kept going thereon this did not damage or burn wood underneath the gold overlay.<br> The reason that this altar has not been mentioned together with the major altar standing outside the sanctuary, details of which the Torah described in Parshat Terumah, is that this altar was not intended to ensure that the Shechinah made its permanent home among the Jewish people. The purpose of all the other furnishings in the Tabernacle was just that. (compare how G’d defined this purpose in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.25.8-9"" data-ref=""Exodus 25:8-9"">Exodus 25,8-9</a>) Its purpose was also not to attract the glory of the Lord into the Tabernacle, as was the purpose of all the other communal sacrifices burnt-offering, gift offerings, etc. Concerning G’d’s response to those offerings we had read in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.29.43"" data-ref=""Exodus 29:43"">Exodus 29,43</a> ונועדתי שמה לבני ישראל, “and there I will meet with the Children of Israel.” Moses himself had confirmed that this was the purpose of the furnishings, etc., in the Tabernacle when he said: (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.9.6"" data-ref=""Leviticus 9:6"">Leviticus 9,6</a>) “and as a result the glory of the Lord will become manifest to you.”<br> The sole purpose of the golden altar was to honour G’d after He had accepted our service with goodwill mornings and evenings. We used this as a means to welcome His presence by presenting the incense. We find that <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Chronicles.16.29"" data-ref=""I Chronicles 16:29"">Chronicles I 16,29</a> expresses this thought, David saying:הבו לה\' כבוד שמו ובאו לפניו, “Ascribe to the Lord the glory of His name!”']"
Exodus, 30,4,"['שתי צלעותיו, at the upper corners.', 'שני צדיו, the side walls. [seeing that the altar was a cube, i.e. the sides were no longer than the length, I find this difficult. Ed.]\n']"
Exodus, 30,12,"['כי תשא..ונתנו איש כפר נפשו, the need to count human beings stems from the fact that human beings are not the same each time, i.e. ever since death was decreed upon mankind this reflects sin. Prior to sin man, who was meant to live indefinitely, would be the same at each count. The sages have said that no one dies unless he had committed a sin (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.55"" data-ref=""Shabbat 55"">Shabbat 55</a>). It follows that mention of a head count of people is an oblique reminder of man’s sin, his guilt. This being so, it is most appropriate that at the time of such count he should pay some ransom on behalf of his soul, his life, so that he will qualify for atonement. This also explains why the poor must not give less nor the rich more, as a soul’s ransom is not calculated in terms of the amount of money offered to G’d.']"
Exodus, 30,18,"['ועשית כיור, this is another vessel which has not been mentioned before with the other vessels that were part of the Tabernacle. The reason is that the basin was not instrumental in attracting the presence of the Shechinah to the Tabernacle. Its function was merely preparatory to the priests’ service in the Tabernacle.']"
Exodus, 30,24,"['ושמן זית הין, there can be no doubt that the small quantity of oil mentioned here could not have been sufficient to anoint all the sacred vessels mentioned here including the Tabernacle itself. This could only have been achieved if merely a minute part of each vessel had to be covered with that oil, or, if the quantity of anointing oil mentioned here had been placed in a large container with water and had first been boiled in it, so that the thinned down version was used to accomplish what is described here as “anointing.” There is a disagreement of how precisely this was done in Horiyot 11.']"
Exodus, 30,25,"['רוקח מרקחת, a mixture of spices of a mixture of same, i.e. the result of two mixtures, having been boiled in water after having been mixed thoroughly with the other listed ingredients. ']"
Exodus, 30,31,"['יהיה זה לי לדורותיכם, this oil of holy anointing for Me will last throughout your generations.']"
Exodus, 30,34,"['קח לך סמים, the ones already mentioned in connection with the oil of anointing in verse 23-24 plus the three mentioned in this verse, i.e. נטף, שחלה, חלבנה, and in addition to these some other spices known to act as improving the mixture of those already listed. According to our sages in Keritut 6 Shibbolet, Nerd, Karkom and Kosht were such spices which when blended in with the ones listed in the Torah already would provide the balance of fragrance the Torah wanted to achieve. [The problem facing commentators is the fact that even when we add all the spices or oils mentioned in this chapter together, even assuming that frankincense is one of them, we only arrive at a total of eight, whereas traditionally there were supposed to be 11 as we mention in our daily prayer of Pittum haketoret. Ed.]', 'ולבונה זכה, this pure frankincense did not need to be mixed with any other ingredient to achieve the Torah’s purpose as part of the incense. This helps us arrive at the number 11 our sages state were contained in the mixture presented on the golden altar.\n']"
Exodus, 30,35,"['רקח, each of whom would collect different spices and after mixing them all they would become', 'מעשה רוקח, crushed, mixed, etc., a druggist’s handiwork. These various spices did not undergo uniform treatment at the hands of the spicer, druggist..', 'ממולח, thoroughly mixed, none of its ingredients remaining identifiable as separate substances.', 'טהור. refined to such a degree that it did not contain any foreign substances. The reason why this was of the essence was the fact that the burning up of the incense consisted of burning up the actual spices, derivatives or auxiliaries not being a part of that sacrifice at all. However, with the oil of anointing these extreme precautions did not apply seeing that it was in the nature of the ingredients that auxiliary components were not mixed with it or attached to it before the oil became refined.\n']"
Exodus, 31,2,"['ראה קראתי בשם, try and understand that I did not appoint Betzalel for this task arbitrarily, as it is of the essence that someone who is very senior also in spiritual matters must carry out such a sacred task as fashioning the parts of the Tabernacle. Such a person must not only have in mind the desire to technically execute first class artisanship, but he must constantly be conscious of performing a Divine commandment.']"
Exodus, 31,13,"['אך את שבתותי תשמורו, even though it was I Who commanded you to build the Tabernacle and to construct all its appurtenances, and it is to serve as a residence for My presence, this commandment does not override the restrictions associated with proper observance of the Sabbath. The reason is that the Sabbath is', 'אות היא ביני וביניכם, a symbol serving as a reminder of our mutual relationship. If you were to ignore this symbol by building a residence for Me on this day, there would be no point in doing so as I would not then take up residence in that Tabernacle. \n']"
Exodus, 31,14,"['ושמרתם את השבת, there is yet another reason why the Sabbath regulations must not be overridden for the sake of completing the Tabernacle sooner;', 'כי קדש היא לכם, מחלליה מות יומת, the Sabbath is not only a holy day for you, i.e. it is not only a positive commandment to observe it, but is also a most important negative commandment, so much so that deliberate violation, desecration of it sanctity, is punishable by death. Seeing that building the Tabernacle is only a positive commandment, it is clear that a positive commandment cannot override something that is both a positive and a negative commandment.', 'כל העושה בה מלאכה ונכרתה הנפש ההיא, another reason for not desecrating the Sabbath in order to carry on with the building of the Tabernacle is the extremely heavy penalty associated with deliberate violation of the laws of the Sabbath. The reason for such a penalty is that anyone violating the concept of the Sabbath prohibitions thereby denies that I, G’d, created the universe out of no preexisting tangible substance. Anyone desecrating the Sabbath deliberately would never benefit from the existence of a building such as the Tabernacle. How could he claim a share in the G’d Who dwells in this Tabernacle?', 'מקרב עמיה, from those members of his people who are destined to live on in the world to come after their bodies are left behind on earth by their souls.\n']"
Exodus, 31,15,"['ששת ימים יעשה מלאכה, during the six days of the week which correspond to the days when G’d created the universe you can busy yourselves with working on the construction of the Tabernacle. There is no good reason why this project should override the commandments governing the Sabbath. The only time a commandment overrides such commandments is when the Torah linked the commandment which would override it to a specific time frame, such as the circumcision of a baby on the eighth day after its birth, or the type of sacrificial service in the Tabernacle of which the Torah said that it must be performed every day i.e. including on the Sabbath. Any other commandment that is capable of being performed on a day other than the Sabbath does not override the Sabbath.', 'שבת שבתון; this expression alludes to the fact that there are activities and even conversations and thoughts which, though not specifically outlawed by the text, are nevertheless something that interfere with the proper Sabbath observance. We have been told already in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.12"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:12"">Exodus 23,12</a> וביום השביעי תשבות, that the cessation of work etc., has as its objective קדש לה\', that this day is to be holy for the Lord, i.e. we are to make it holy. This means that on the Sabbath we ignore secular matters altogether and devote ourselves to spiritual pursuits, and even the mundane pursuits such as eating festive meals must be perceived as part of our honouring G’d on the Sabbath.', 'כל העושה מלאכה...יומת. It follows that when someone performs secular tasks on the Sabbath he automatically loses track of the purpose of the Sabbath, hence he deserves to be executed.\n']"
Exodus, 31,16,"['ושמרו במי ישראל את השבת, in this life, לעשות את השבת, on a day that is totally Shabbat. [the afterlife. Ed]\n']"
Exodus, 31,17,"['וביום השביעי שבת, seeing that on that day the creative activity of G’d had been completed, completion spells rest,', 'וינפש, this is why the seventh day is one devoted to the נפש, the spirit, resulting in G’d giving Jews an additional soul for use on that day. This additional soul assists us in concentrating on the spiritual dimension of the day. When man was created, G’d made him in His image, i.e. first and foremost concerned with spiritual concerns. The extra soul granted us on the Sabbath is to help us live up to that vision G’d had of man when He created him. (compare Beytzah 16)']"
Exodus, 31,18,"['ויתן אל משה ככלותו, after the Torah described all the spiritual accomplishments which should have resulted from the many days Moses had spent on the mountain with G’d, the Torah now has to explain why all these spiritual accomplishments G’d had envisaged did not in fact materialise so that it became necessary to build a Tabernacle, etc., in order to achieve these spiritual accomplishments via a different route. The Torah explains that the cause of this detour in the spiritual ascent of the people was the abuse they had made of the freedom of choice. They, who had been about to receive the set of Tablets made and written by G’d Himself at the end of Moses’ stay on Mount Sinai for forty days, who were all to personify the ideal of being priests, and a holy nation, rebelled, corrupted themselves, as testified in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:6"">Exodus 33,6</a> when they divested themselves of the signs of the covenant G’d had made with them, removing the garments emblazoned with the blood of that covenant.', 'שני לוחות העדות, the ones of which we heard in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.24.12"" data-ref=""Exodus 24:12"">Exodus 24,12</a> where G’d had told Moses prior to his ascending the mountain: “I will give you there the Tablets of stone, etc.” Before G’d had a chance to give the people the written Torah they already began with the golden calf episode so that G’d had to tell Moses to precipitously descend from the mountain warning him that his people had become corrupt.

Exodus, 32,13,"['וכל הארץ הזאת אשר אמרתי אתן לזרעכם ונחלו, a reference to the fourth generation of the Emorite mentioned by G’d at the covenant between the pieces.

Exodus, 32,19,"['וירא את העגל ואת המחולות ויחר אף משה, Moses’ anger was aroused over the fact that people rejoiced over the damage to themselves they had caused.

Exodus, 32,21,"['הבאת עליו חטאה גדולה, a reference to the display of merriment in serving the golden calf. Moses criticised Aaron for having proclaimed the feast which led to this rejoicing over the golden calf instead of instead of being a feast for G’d. On account of this he was forced to entreat G’d for an additional measure of mercy for His people. This is also what he meant when addressing the people saying: אתם חטאתם חטאה גדולה “you have committed an exceedingly great sin,” (verse 30) Also, when appealing to G’d, he commences by saying that the people had been guilty of an exceedingly serious sin (verse 31). This theme returns once more when G’d speaks of עון-פשע-וחטאה, sins of three different levels of seriousness in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:7"">Exodus 34,7</a>. In 34,9 Moses begs for forgiveness for two of these categories of sin, עון and חטא, not daring to ask for forgiveness for פשע, deliberate taunting of G’ by one’s sin. Moses. who had shown understanding for the fact that Aaron had been under great pressure in acceding to the making of the golden calf, cannot understand why he lent his hand to heaping additional sin on the people by having declared a public holiday. He had not been under pressure to do that and should have known that the people would understand this as an invitation to celebrate the new leader, replacing Moses.']"
Exodus, 32,22,"['כי ברע הוא. They were already so deeply involved in the sin, having been used to the idolatry they had been addicted to in the hundreds of years in Egypt.\n']"
Exodus, 32,24,"['?ואומר להן למי זהב, I was assuming or hoping that there would not be any raw gold handy to be used to make into any kind of jewelry.', 'התפרקו ויתנו לי, but against my expectations they removed golden jewelry and donated it for this purpose.', 'ואשליכהו באש, I tried to delay matters, throwing the gold into the fire, as is, without making any of the customary preparations performed by goldsmiths, activities which preheat the gold so it can cast properly to be fashioned into the desired shapes.', 'ויצא העגל הזה. This happened spontaneously, without my having done anything once I had thrown the gold into the crucible. The people did not wait until I had performed any action on my own. When we read in verse four ויעשהו עגל מסכה, the Torah did not refer to Aaron having made the cast calf, but it referred to whoever it was who interfered and shaped the gold. We have a similar construction in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.3.8"" data-ref=""Leviticus 3:8"">Leviticus 3,8</a> וסמך את ידו, “he will place his hand firmly,” where the subject is not Aaron but whoever owns the animal that is about to be slaughtered as a sacrifice. The same applies to the word ושחט in that same context. It is not a specific person, but the priest who performs the duty in the Temple on that particular day. When we read in verse 35 אשר עשו את העגל אשר עשה אהרן, the meaning of this line is “the people made the calf in which Aaron had participated to some extent.” They had shaped it, whereas Aaron had only taken raw gold and thrown it into the fire. [When reading our author’s commentary it becomes clear why the Talmud in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.49"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 49"">Kidushin 49</a> forbade translating these parts of the Torah into Aramaic during public readings, as the people who need the translation due to their failure to understand the original Hebrew would be apt to misunderstand Aaron’s part in this disaster.

Exodus, 32,25,"['כי פרוע הוא, they are totally corrupt, committing their sins in public without shame. The public deeds reveal their deep-seated corruption.', 'כי פרעה אהרן, Aaron had brought to light the fact that there are no righteous people among them. Had there been any righteous people among them, surely they would have come to the assistance of Aaron so that Aaron would not have been forced to have a share in this golden calf at all.', 'לשמצה בקמיהם.Giving them a bad name among their enemies. Israel’s enemies would say about them that they had breached their covenant with their Lord, and that there was not a single one among them who was a good person, and that they did not even heed the instructions of their prophets. Even though only a small minority had ganged up on Aaron, the entire people’s reputation would now be dragged through the mud.\n']"
Exodus, 32,27,['עברו ושובו משער לשער; in order to secure atonement for those members of the people who had not actively participated in the sin but were guilty of not having protested the sin. By not now protesting the execution of the guilty ones either they proved deserving of being forgiven. ']
Exodus, 32,29,"[""'מלאו ידכם היום לה, acquire for yourselves some degree of perfection today! Today you will become worthy to perform service in G’d’s Temple in the future!"", 'כי איש בבנו ובאחיו, for each one of you have already become sanctified to G’d through having circumcised his own son for G’d, something you did in the desert. (according to Sifrey Behaalotcha,15, the tribe of Levi were the only ones who observed this commandment while the people were in the desert). [how many Levites could have been circumcised during the 89 days since the Passover and the return of Moses from Mount Sinai? Ed.] Therefore, מלאו ידכם prove this sense of loyalty again by becoming blessed through assuming this difficult task of carrying out His instructions now. ובאחיו, and today you have again demonstrated your loyalty of spilling the blood of even your own brothers.  Moses gave recognition to this collective act of loyalty to G’d in preference to loyalty to their fellow Jew in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.33.9-11"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 33:9-11"">Deuteronomy 33,9-11</a> when he said about this tribe:כי שמרו אמרתך ובריתך ינצורו,.... ברך ה\' חילו ופעל ידיו תרצה, “for they have observed Your word and Your covenant they preserved. Bless, Hashem, his resources and favour the works of his hand.” ']"
Exodus, 32,30,"['אתם חטאתם חטאה גדולה, “realise the extent of your sin, for if you ponder this you will surely become penitents!”  We find a parallel syntax in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.5"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:5"">Psalms 51,5</a> כי פשעי אני אדע, “for I have come to realise the rebellious nature of my conduct.” [David feels that by being aware of the truly terrible nature of his transgressions he may qualify for help in rehabilitating himself. The specific nature of David’s transgression was the desecration of G’d’s name in arranging for the death of Bat Sheva’s husband so that he could marry Bat Sheva. While the Talmud had declared that he did not commit a technical sin when sleeping with Bat Sheva, his moral sin was something quite different. Ed.] In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.3.13"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 3:13"">Jeremiah 3,13</a> we also encounter a syntax reflecting the approach taken here by the Torah. The prophet wrote אך דעי עונך, “if you were only to understand the meaning of your iniquity!” He does not add “repent!” but takes it for granted that awareness of the implications of the wrong one has done will automatically result in penitence.\n']"
Exodus, 32,32,"['אם תשא חטאתם ואם אין מחני נא מספרך, regardless if You, G’d, will forgive their sins or will not forgive them, wipe out any merits I have accumulated in Your Book and transfer them to the credit balance of this people.']"
Exodus, 32,33,"['מי אשר חטא לי אמחנו מספרי, the idea that I will wipe out the merits of those who have not sinned against Me in order that through your loss of these credits they may qualify for My forgiveness is a non starter. This would be  a brand new system of justice. The system of reward and retribution I have practiced is based on the fact that the sinner would have to pay for his sin, while receiving reward for his good deeds. I do not recognise a system whereby sins can be offset against previously accumulated merits, or vice versa. If I do not recognise such trade-offs of the sins and good deeds of the same individual against one another, I most certainly will not allow the transfer of other people’s merits to wipe out the debit balance of a third party. As a result of these considerations, your proposal is not acceptable.\n']"
Exodus, 32,34,"['אל אשר דברתי לך, when I said to you “I will take you out from the afflictions in Egypt (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.3.17"" data-ref=""Exodus 3:17"">Exodus 3,17</a>) to a good land etc.”,(verse 8 same chapter).', 'וביום פקדי, in the event that they will commit further sins, (such as the sin of the spies)', 'ופקדתי עליהם חטאתם, this sin, and I will not continue to waive their punishment for this sin. We find a similar statement in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.1.52"" data-ref=""I Kings 1:52"">Kings I 1,52</a> ואם רעה תמצא בו ומת, “if he commits any further evil he will die.” (Adoniah, Solomon’s older brother and former rival for the succession) We find that G’d comes back to this threat in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.14.11"" data-ref=""Numbers 14:11"">Numbers 14,11</a> complaining “how long will this people spurn Me, etc.” Seeing that they repeated their rebellious behaviour one could only expect that they would persist in their foolish ways. Our sages used this to coin the phrase that “when a person has sinned, gotten away with it, and sinned again, and again gotten away with it, he thinks that what he did is not even sinful” (so that he has no incentive to repent what he has come to believe is permissible conduct) (Yuma 86)\n']"
Exodus, 32,35,"['על אשר עשו את העגל אשר עשה אהרן, by Aaron’s agreeing, not protesting, he helped a potential sin become an actual sin, so that the person’s sin who fashioned the gold into the shape of a calf is attributable to Aaron. Aaron’s contribution in deed was his throwing the gold into the fire. He himself describes the “this calf emerged,” as a direct consequence of his throwing the gold into the fire (verse 24).']"
Exodus, 33,2,"['ושלחתי לפניך מלאך, the very angel who introduces himself to Joshua (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.5.14"" data-ref=""Joshua 5:14"">Joshua 5,14</a>) as the שר צבא ה\', “Commander in Chief of G’d’s hosts.”']"
Exodus, 33,3,"['אל ארץ זבת חלב ודבש, the wording suggests that the place where G’d made this promise is dry and that it requires miracles by G’d to gain an adequate livelihood from that earth. At this point in time the Israelites had not qualified for G’d to perform such miracles for them. G’d promises that they would proceed to a land where they would not have to depend on constant miracles in order to gain their livelihood. [The author may have mentioned this as we know that around Mount Sinai at the time there was plenty of grazing land, suggesting that it might have been a fit location to settle. Ed.]', 'כי לא אעלה בקרבך, this is why I am telling you to move on from here, you and the people (verse 1). Do not wait to break and make camp at G’d’s signal, i.e the moving of the cloud. G’d explains that His not moving with the people would be for their protection,', 'פן אכלך בדרך, lest I would be forced to kill you while you are on the way. G’d implies that if He were to be present personally when the people sinned, their punishment would be commensurably greater for having rebelled against the presence of G’d also.\n']"
Exodus, 33,5,"['רגע אחד אעלה בקרבך וכליתיך, whereas at this time you are mourning about My not being personally in your midst, (verse 3) you fail to understand that this is intended for your benefit, and may save you from instant extinction. You are, after all, such a stiff-necked people unwilling to respond to admonition, even though at the revelation of Mount Sinai you had become equipped to attain spiritual perfection.', 'ועתה הורד עדיך מעליך, this spiritual preparedness which you attained at the revelation is something that G’d does not unilaterally remove from the people as we have a rule that gifts are not revoked without the consent of the recipient. Our sages have phrased it thus in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Taanit.25"" data-ref=""Taanit 25"">Taanit 25</a> (where the golden leg miraculously given to Rabbi Chanina was taken back only after he had prayed for it to revert to where it came from.)', 'ואדעה מה אעשה לך, for once you do this as an admission of your guilt you will not be guilty of the ultimate punishment.\n']"
Exodus, 33,7,"['וקרא לו אהל מועד, in order for the people to know that there G’d would communicate with him as opposed to within the boundaries of the encampment of the people.']"
Exodus, 33,11,"['פנים אל פנים, as opposed to נופל וגלוי עינים, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.24.4"" data-ref=""Numbers 24:4"">Numbers 24,4</a>) as Bileam described his visions which came to him only when he had lost control over his own senses.', 'כאשר ידבר איש אל רעהו, as opposed to soliloquizing, [as in praying but not receiving an answer.]', 'לא ימיש מתוך האוהל, in order to ensure that none of the Israelites would enter this tent, seeing all of them were in a state of disgrace. This tent was reserved for the presence of the Shechinah out of bounds, as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.3.5"" data-ref=""Exodus 3:5"">Exodus 3,5</a> where Moses was warned not to come close while wearing footwear. The reason that at that time even Moses was not admitted as he was, shows that he was not yet spiritually equipped for that degree of communication from G’d.\n']"
Exodus, 33,12,"['ראה, do not turn your face away but take my comment seriously.', 'אתה אומר אלי העל את העם הזה, when You said to me in verse 1 “lead up this people, etc.,” ', 'ואתה לא הודעתני את אשר תשלח עמי, the promise that You would send an angel with me (verse 2) was to take effect only once the people would enter the land of Canaan, at which time the promise that with the help of the angel we would dispossess the Canaanites would be fulfilled. But, in the meantime, who is going to be our protective force? How can we be without either an angel or Your personal presence? Moreover,', 'ואתה אמרת ידעתיך בשם, when You paid me such a compliment, surely this did not mean that You will leave me to my own devices on this journey? Surely, such feelings as expressed in Zeacharyah 11,9 where You are quoted as  saying: “I am not going to tend you, let the one that is to die die, and the one that is to get lost get lost, and let the rest devour each other’s flesh.” “Surely, You had intended for me to be the angel who leads the people of Israel.”\n']"
Exodus, 33,13,"['ועתה, since You had agreed that I should be the angel,', 'הודיעני נא את דרכך, acquaint me with Your two miraculous ways, 1) how simply by Your knowledge of something You can make these figments of Your will or imagination become automatically a reality as demonstrated whenever  You perform supernatural miracles, and 2) how by Your unfailingly accurate knowledge of future events, such knowledge does not impair the freedom of choice of man to do what he wants.', 'ואדעך, so that I will know You, as knowledge of Your actions does convey some inkling of the considerations which resulted in such actions.', 'למען אמצא חן בעיניך, by possessing such knowledge and an appreciation of Your mode of operation I will myself attain favour in Your eyes.

Compare psalms 76,2 on this subject, i.e. נודע ביהודה אלוקים בישראל גדול שמו, “G’d is known in Yehudah; His name is great in Israel (exclusively). Seeing that this is so it is not appropriate for You to withhold from me the answer to what I have requested on account of their sin “ Moses’ argument is in line with what we were told in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.11"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 11"">Sanhedrin 11</a> and <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bava_Batra.134"" data-ref=""Bava Batra 134"">Baba Batra 134</a> that there were at different times (Hillel’s students) 30 people whose personal stature was such that they deserved that the Presence of G’d rest on them. If it did not, this was only because their contemporaries did not deserve that G’d’s presence manifest itself in their lifetime.\n']"
Exodus, 33,14,"['פני ילכו, when you are moving toward the Holy Land My presence will walk before you. The emphasis here is on the word “before” instead of G’d saying “among you” [the author is reading this into the text as G’d left the definition of where His presence would be wide open. Ed.]', 'והניחותי לך; will give you rest from your enemies around you, so that you will bring the people into the land in safety.\n']"
Exodus, 33,15,"['אם אין פניך הולכים, now already when we are still encamped, seeing that You have withdrawn Your presence, then You better do not bring us any further from here for it would be preferable for us to remain here in the desert than to enter the Holy Land without Your Presence among us. By staying right here, we would at least be exposed to the manifestation of Your continued Presence.', '“do not make us leave this place.” We would rather remain in the desert than enter the Holy Land unaccompanied by Your <i>Shechinah</i>, for without it we would undoubtedly incur exile in just a short while.']"
Exodus, 33,16,"['ובמה יודע איפא, even though we may indeed enter the Holy Land and the angel will drive out the Canaanites, how would anyone become aware that what was happening was orchestrated by Divine forces? After all, people get driven out from their land in war all the time! There is nothing supernatural in such a phenomenon.', 'הלא בלכתך עמנו ונפלינו, Moses refers to statements such as the ones he made in his song after the Egyptians drowned in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.15.13-14"" data-ref=""Exodus 15:13-14"">Exodus 15,13-14</a> נחית בחסדך עם זו גאלת נהלת בעזך שמעו עמים ירגזון; “In Your love You led the people You redeemed; in Your strength You guide them to Your holy abode.” The people hear and tremble;” the reason the people tremble is because they watch miracles happening, indicating that the Jewish nation is a nation apart. As a result, they will lose their courage to resist the conquest, as Rachav testified even almost 40 years later when she told the spies that everyone is aware of the miracle G’d had wrought on behalf of His people and that no one has any courage left which would make him fight with a chance of success.

Exodus, 33,19,"['אני אעביר כל טובי על פניך, this will not be denied due to My not being unwilling to bestow these insights. As proof,', ""אעביר כל טובי על פניך וקראתי בשם ה' לפניך, G’d proclaims what He says using the name of Hashem, the “name” which informs people and teaches them about His existence as the G’d whose ways are those pf goodness. By saying that He will parade all of His goodness before Moses, He implies that if Moses had been capable of understanding all of the hidden aspects of G’d’s essence He would indeed have fulfilled all of Moses’ requests. Nonetheless, i.e. in spite of Moses’ or better, man’s inherent inability to understand all of this, G’d will reveal a fragment of His modus operandi; by doing this Moses would acquire a glimpse of G’d’s essence as portrayed in 34,5. "", 'וחנותי את אשר אחון, I will grant you the degree of insights I  grant all those who find favour in My eyes. I am in the habit of being very generous in the application of this principle.', 'ורחמתי את אשר ארחם, I will use My attribute of Mercy so that you will not die during the experience, just as it is My custom to extend mercy to all those who, in My opinion, qualify for such.  In practice this means that I will put My hand over you shielding you, as we read in verse 22.\n']"
Exodus, 33,20,"['ויאמר לא תוכל לראות, your inability to see what you would like to see is not due to My depriving you, personally, of such an experience, but is rooted in man’s inability to “see” such things unless you had died first, as an eye of flesh and blood cannot “see” such things. You would be fatally blinded before understanding anything you would “see.”']"
Exodus, 33,21,"['הנה מקום אתי, there does exist a place from which visions of G’d can be obtained, the place where both Moses and the prophet Elijah stood in a cave or beside a cave as described in Pessachim 54 as one the 10 items G’d created at dusk on the sixth day of creation.']"

Our sages define this as מעביר ראשון ראשון, He decides in favour of the accused when his merits and demerits are in balance.', 'ואמת, the adjective רב, “abundant” mentioned in connection with the attribute חסד also applies to the attribute אמת. The mention of the attribute אמת is important as if we had only known about G’d’s patience with the sinner, i.e. ארך אפים, we might have concluded that the sinner might eventually get away with his sin. The attribute אמת is a reminder that if the sinner who enjoyed G’d’s patience did not use it to repent, his sins will catch up with him. G’d does not wipe out the sin. It also refers to what our sages described as the meaning of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.10.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 10:17"">Deuteronomy 10,17</a> that G’d does not show favoritism, i.e. an illustrious’ father such as Avraham cannot save his son Yishmael from punishment, nor a Yitzchok his son Esau. Similarly, it includes the fact that G’d does not accept “bribes,” and that sins cannot be offset by good deeds so that the sin goes unpunished.']"
Exodus, 34,7,"['נוצר חסד לאלפים, He preserves the accumulated merits of the fathers and will let the children draw on these merits.', 'נושא עון, premeditated sin.', 'ופשע, sins intended to challenge G’d.', 'וחטאה, additional to the taunting sin called פשע.

This is why all these attributes have been enumerated separately.', 'ונקה, even though G’d wipes the slate clean for those penitents motivated by their love for G’d and not by their fear of punishment, לא ינקה, He will not do this for the ones whose only motivation for turning penitent is their fear of G’d’s retribution, or their desire to arrest such retribution. We find confirmation of this in Yuma 86 that i.e. intentional sins of such penitents will be treated as if they had been unintentionally committed sins, a conclusion based on Hoseah 14,2 כי כשלת בעונך, “for you have fallen because of your sin.”', 'פוקד עון אבות על בנים, He delays punishing the wicked in the land until their measure of sin is such that they deserve to be wiped out. This “measure” is one that in G’d’s opinion, precludes their ever becoming penitents. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.9"" data-ref=""Sotah 9"">Sotah 9</a>). Such a situation usually is not reached until several successive generations are steeped in sin.', 'על שלשים, when the latest generation intensifies the evil perpetrated by their fathers and grandfathers. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.7.26"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 7:26"">Jeremiah 7,26</a> describes such a scenario when he writes: “they would not listen to Me or give ear.

Exodus, 34,15,"['פן תכרות ברית, the Torah immediately explains that the reason why entering into contractual relationships with the inhabitants of the land of Canaan is a non starter, is that once you do that the way is open for them to corrupt you by one of two means; either they will woo your sons to marry their daughters or vice versa. It is only the most elementary courtesy then that they invite you to partake in their festive meals (animals offered to their deities) You will not resist such invitations because you do not want to offend the women whom you love.

Exodus, 34,17,"['אלוהי מסכה, graven images; some cameos, worn at times when certain horoscopes, constellations, dominate the sky; they are intended to protect the wearer. (compare Maimonides, Moreh, 1,63) The reason why these cameos are cast is that all of their parts must be made simultaneously, symbolising the simultaneous appearance of such constellations of certain stars. The people serving these constellations believe that they can improve the quality of their lives by means of goodwill extended to them by these stars. The Torah warns against this practice because the person doing this may not even consider that this constitutes a rebellion against the Creator seeing he does not accept these stars as “gods.” G’d looks at the matter differently, not wanting any of us to turn to any source other than Him for all our wishes and prayers. This is why we recite in our daily prayers ואנחנו לא נדע מה נעשה כי עליך עינינו, “for we do not know what we could do, seeing that our eyes are turned exclusively to You.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Chronicles.20.12"" data-ref=""II Chronicles 20:12"">Chronicles II 20,12</a>)']"
Exodus, 34,18,"['את חג המצות תשמור, after the Torah warned us against a graven image meant to improve the quality of our life on this planet, it turns to the commandments the function of which it is (if performed) to assure us of “so-called” success in spring, during the harvest in summer, when gathering the last harvests in autumn, and success in our business endeavours. The Torah enumerates the commandments concerned in the order in which we just listed them.<br> חג המצות למועד חודש האביב, observance of this commandment is to insure that our springtime activities will be blessed. The offering of the firstborns are designed to ensure that our summer time activities will be blessed. This commandment was given immediately after the Exodus. It is intended to ensure that our livestock will be blessed. Third is the commandment to observe the Sabbath, a commandment given to the people at Marah, several weeks before the revelation at Mount Sinai. The objective of Sabbath observance is to ensure that our endeavours during the six days of the week will be blessed with success. The fourth commandment is that of observing the festival of Shavuot, in the early summer, as a result of which the grain harvest will be blessed. The fifth commandment mentioned here is the Sukkot festival, observance of which is to ensure the success of the grape harvest, etc. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.16.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 16:17"">Deuteronomy 16,17</a> spells out that the festivals’ aim is to make us conscious of the blessings we have been given by G’d.<br> Having listed specific commandments, the Torah adds a comprehensive commandment applying on each of the three festivals mentioned previously, the pilgrimage to be made by the males to the Temple.<br>This is followed by some details about the festival of matzot in verse 25, followed by a commandment usually observed on Shavuot, the harvest festival, when most of the first fruit has ripened already (verse 26) and the bringing of the first ripened fruit by each farmer accompanied by a thanksgiving prayer is in full swing until Sukkot. This, in turn, is followed by a prohibition not to boil the kid in the milk of its mother, seeing that it is the time of year when most young goats are born.

Exodus, 34,19,"['כל פטר רחם לי, the commandment applies to male humans and male new born animals of the categories that are domesticated and fit to eat for Jews. Seeing that one category of “unclean” animal, the donkey, is also part of this legislation, though, of course such an animal is not fit to be sacrificed on the altar of the Temple, the Torah has to add certain qualifications when writing about this commandment. Whereas the “pure” firstborn may not be redeemed and made secular, but must themselves be offered on the altar, their blood and fat remaining there, the donkey either has to be redeemed or to be killed in a manner that precludes its flesh being used commercially.

Exodus, 34,21,"['ששת ימים תעבוד וביום השביעי תשבות, success of your activities during the six days of the week also is materially affected by whether and how you observe the Sabbath.', 'בחריש ובקציר תשבות, not only is Sabbath rest mandatory in the winter when the farmer has no urgent agricultural tasks, but also in the summer. Moreover, just as he will rest every seventh day he will rest every seventh year for the entire year. The Sh’mittah legislation applies both in summer and in winter. Both the weekly Sabbath, and the seven-yearly “Sabbath” have been called Sabbath by the Torah. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.25.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 25:2"">Leviticus 25,2</a>) The success of our activities during the six years preceding the Sh’mittah year assumes that during the seventh year we will observe G’d’s law to abstain from agricultural activities. \n']"
Exodus, 34,23,"['את פני האדון, who arranges your affairs in a natural manner.

In order to make this point clear G’d Himself is not just described as elohim, but as אלוקי האלוקים, “the G’d of gods.” We find this mode of expression also when He is described as אדוני האדונים “the Lord of lords.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.10.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 10:17"">Deuteronomy 10,17</a>) When such terms are used they describe Him Who arranges every supernatural event The Torah here legislates that every male Israelite is to pay a visit to the place where this G’d is in residence on earth. He is to use these opportunities to give thanks for all the good things he has experienced, the natural ones, reminding him that all of these are not so “natural,” but accrue to them inasmuch as He is אדון ישראל. The supernatural benefits we experience are initiated, however, by G’d in His capacity as אלוקי ישראל. \n']"

This portion repeats everything that has already been mentioned in connection with the instructions in Parshat Terumah. The reason why the Torah repeated all this is to inform us that when it came to the execution of the project they did everything so as to correspond to G’d’s will and to bring it to conclusion and make it functional as G’d desired. הארון, seeing that the Ark was the most distinguished of the furnishings of the Tabernacle, Betzalel, the master craftsman and architect fashioned this item personally. The sages say of Betzalel that he was capable of using the letters of the alphabet of the Holy Tongue in a manner similar to the way G’d had used them when creating the universe.

Exodus, 38,21,"['אלה פקודי המשכן, all the individual components described previously are the ones concerning which the Torah wrote ובשמות תפקדו את כלי משמרת הקדש...ביד איתמר, “you shall list by name the objects that are their porterage tasks.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.4.32-33"" data-ref=""Numbers 4:32-33"">Numbers 4,32-33</a>) The meaning of the line is that each and everyone of these items was important enough to be known by its specific name. In other words, one did not refer to it only by the name of the category of utensils it belonged to, such as “fork,” but one had a name for each fork. This method of naming each item individually contributed to their being of permanent significance. The Talmud Yuma 71 goes to the length of stating categorically that if anyone thought that once such a utensil had been “used up,” i.e. had outlived its usefulness it would be permanently consigned to oblivion this is not so. It will even resurface after the resurrection of the people who used it when they were alive. This is derived from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.26.15"" data-ref=""Exodus 26:15"">Exodus 26,15</a> עצי שטים עומדים, the word עומדים being taken to mean that they will endure indefinitely. Neither will any of the utensils used in the Tabernacle fall into the hands of our enemies. This is the opposite of what happened to the “permanent” Temple, בית עולמים, built by Solomon. It is significant that in the account of what Nebuchadnezzar captured not a word is mentioned about a single item that used to be part of the Tabernacle in the desert.', 'משכן העדות, the Torah begins to list the many ways in which this Temple (Tabernacle) was superior to  those that superseded it. Firstly, it was the משכן העדות, so named because the Tablets of the Testimony were deposited therein. Secondly, אשר פקד על פי משה, it had been put up at the command of Moses; thirdly, עבודת הלוים ביד איתמר, the entire service of the Levites had been entrusted to the illustrious Ittamar, son of Aaron. Fourthly, ובצלאל בן אורי בן חור למטה יהודה עשה,  the divinely inspired Betzalel was its principal architect. In view of all the above advantages of this structure none of it fell into enemy hands.<br> By contrast, the Temple erected by Solomon, most of the work for which was performed by labourers from Tzor, even though the Shechinah came to rest on it, was eventually destroyed, all of it having been lost totally. The inferiority of that structure is evident from the fact that the building itself was in need of regular, almost annual, repairs, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.22.5"" data-ref=""II Kings 22:5"">Kings II 22,5</a> The second Temple was so inferior that it could not even be called משכן העדות, the residence of the Testimony, the Tablets having long since been lost. Neither had it been established by G’d’s command but by a dream that a gentile named King Cyrus dreamed that it was his duty to build a temple to the G’d in heaven. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezra.8.15"" data-ref=""Ezra 8:15"">Ezra 8,15</a>. Moreover, there were hardly any Levites that bothered to return to the land of Israel at the time to take part in that return to Zion. In addition to this, consider that among the people building this second Temple, there were also pagans called Tzidonim and Tzurim, as documented in the Book of Ezra.\n']"
Exodus, 38,24,"['כל הזהב, the Torah testifies that the contributions of gold, silver, and copper for the building of the Tabernacle were miniscule in value when compared to the amount of such precious metals which were used in the building of Solomon’s Temple. We read there in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.6.20-35"" data-ref=""I Kings 6:20-35"">Kings I 6, 20-35</a> and <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.7.45-50"" data-ref=""I Kings 7:45-50"">Kings I 7, 45-50</a> about the opulence of that structure. Compared to the restoration of the second Temple in the days of Herod, even Solomon’s Temple could be considered a poor attempt at impressing the world with the Jewish people’s wealth. Notwithstanding all the material wealth invested in both Solomon’s Temple and that of Herod, Moses’ Tabernacle, a collapsible structure, enjoyed far more of G’d’s presence than the Temple Solomon built, not to speak of the second Temple in which the Presence of G’d was never manifest. All of these historical facts teach us that material wealth, even if donated generously, is not a major factor in the success of a Temple dedicated to house the Presence of G’d on earth. G’d’s presence in such a Temple depends on His approval of the lifestyle of the Jews who have built such a Temple for Him. ']"

Leviticus,1,1,"['ויקרא אל משה, always out of the cloud; similar to what was described already at Mount Sinai (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.24.16"" data-ref=""Exodus 24:16"">Exodus 24,16</a>) “He called to Moses on the seventh day out of the cloud.” Moses could never enter the Tabernacle without first having obtained permission to do so.', 'מאהל מועד, to warn Moses not to enter the Tent while G’d’s glory was still there. Our verse speaks of what occurred on the day when Moses had completed erecting the Tabernacle, for it was then that G’d’s glory descended to sanctify the site as well as the ones performing their sacred duties in and around it. All of this is the execution of G’d’s promise in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.29.43-44"" data-ref=""Exodus 29:43-44"">Exodus 29, 43-44</a> ונועדתי שמה לבני ישראל ונקדש בכבודי, וקדשתי את אהל מועד ואת המזבח את אהרן ואת בניו, “and there I will meet with the Israelites and it shall be sanctified by My Presence. I will sanctify the Tent of Meeting, the Altar, Aaron and his sons.” The same procedure occurred when the Temple which Solomon had built, at the time it was being consecrated. We read in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.8.11"" data-ref=""I Kings 8:11"">Kings I 8,11</a> “the priests could not enter and stand there preparatory to performing their sacred service for the glory of the Lord filled the entire House.” Filling the House with His glory was the manner in which the structure became sanctified, as was spelled out in the Book of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.9.3"" data-ref=""I Kings 9:3"">Kings I 9,3</a>. However, after this first day Moses could always enter the sanctuary outside of the Holy of Holies, i.e. up until the dividing curtain, פרכת. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.7.89"" data-ref=""Numbers 7:89"">Numbers 7,89</a> elaborates on this describing that “when Moses entered the Tent of Meeting in order to speak with Him, he would hear the sound of G’d’s voice speaking to him from above the lid of the Holy Ark.”\n']"
Leviticus, 1,2,"['אדם כי יקריב מכם, when he brings himself close to G’d by means of a confession of his sins and by humbling himself. The concept parallels the verse in Hoseah 14,3 ונשלמה פרים שפתינו, “we will pay with bulls after having done so first with our lips.” <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.19"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:19"">Psalms 51,19</a> warns זבחי אלוקים רוח נשברה, “an offering of sacrificial meat is such only if accompanied by a crushed spirit.” The psalmist means that G’d is not interested in the fools who offer sacrificial animals if they have not first humbled themselves. Our sages paraphrase this when pointing out that the Torah does not write here כולכם, your entire selves, but מכם, something emanating from you, i.e. “by excreting the spiritually unworthy parts of you.” (compare Rashi)', 'מן הבהמה, if he chooses to offer a 4-legged mammal, it must only be from either the category of cattle or sheep and goats. Wild roaming, undomesticated beasts, are not permitted to be offered as sacrifices on the altar. This needed to be spelled out as we were taught in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.14.4-5"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 14:4-5"">Deuteronomy 14,4-5</a> that the wild roaming beasts with the distinguishing features that make them “pure” animals are permitted for consumption by Israelites provided they have been slaughtered in the appropriate manner. The animals discussed in these portions as candidates for sacrifices are only the ones mentioned in our verse here, i.e. בקר or צאן. The Torah indicates that such voluntary offerings as are under discussion at this time may even be offered by gentiles and accepted on the altar of the Temple or Tabernacle. When <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.22.25"" data-ref=""Leviticus 22:25"">Leviticus 22,25</a> proscribes offerings tendered by the בני נכר what are meant are not gentiles but Jews who have become estranged to their G’d, have renounced their religion and become meshumadim. These are far worse that gentiles born as such, and that is why G’d rejects their voluntary offerings on His altar. Included are Jews who publicly desecrate the Sabbath. [Eyruvin 69 states that desecrating the Sabbath publicly is equivalent to violating all of G’d’s commandments. Ed.] There are three categories of offerings which may sometimes be voluntary and other times mandatory. These comprise the burnt-offering, עולה, the peace-offering, שלמים, and the gift-offering (non-animal) מנחה. When they are offered by the poor i.e. bird offerings, only pigeons and turtle doves qualify among all the birds. Complementary offerings known as סולת-שמן-לבונה are also part of voluntary offerings on occasion. The sin offerings חטאת and אשם are invariably mandatory offerings. This helps to explain the offerings of Hevel and Kayin and why the offering of Kayin was not accepted by G’d. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.4.5"" data-ref=""Genesis 4:5"">Genesis 4,5</a>) It consisted of material which G’d had not designated as fit to be offered as a gift to Him. The Torah did not simply state that G’d did not turn to Kayin, but that “He did not turn to Kayin and His gift.” In other words, the reason He did not accept Kayin’s offering was that it consisted of matter rejected by G’d as unfit to be an offering to Him. On the other hand, when Noach offered a sacrifice G’d responded not only by accepting it, without further ado, but He reacted to it as if it were the most pleasant smelling fragrance, ריח ניחוח, although burnt flesh and fat most certainly does not exude a pleasant fragrance. What the Torah meant to say there (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.8.21"" data-ref=""Genesis 8:21"">Genesis 8,21</a>) was that G’d accepted the parts of the offering which were fit to please Him as if it were sweet smelling fragrance. (as a result of that offering not only did G’d promise never to bring another deluge, but He permitted man to kill animals for food, something that had been forbidden since Adam’s sin or earlier). Interestingly, the Torah does not say that G’d accepted all of Noach’s offerings, presumably seeing that some pure animals that were of the free roaming category are not acceptable although these animals are fit to be eaten by Jews, and all the more so by gentiles such as Noach. (the author speaks about this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.8.21"" data-ref=""Genesis 8:21"">Genesis 8,21</a> claiming that prior to the giving of the Torah all of the species of “pure” animals were fit as sacrifices.) In connection with the sin offerings it is mandatory for the person trying to obtain forgiveness by means of such mandatory offerings to place his hands on the animal with all his weight, as if attacking it, and praying that it be accepted as a substitute of his own person. Each individual’s sin offering possesses an element of what we are familiar with from the legislation concerning the communal “scapegoat” upon which the High Priest placed his hands, symbolically transferring the many sins of the Jewish people to that animal. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.16.21"" data-ref=""Leviticus 16:21"">Leviticus 16,21</a>) By means of this symbolic act, the humility with which the owner of the sin offering is to approach G’d prior to gaining a chance of acceptance and forgiveness, has been demonstrated. As a result, ונרצה לו לכפר עליו, “G’d will be in a mood to forgive such a person.” Seeing that there are so many different kinds of sin, some of which are merely sinful thoughts, not involving sinful deeds, it is appropriate to ask G’d’s forgiveness also for such sinful thoughts. This is best accomplished as a by product of the voluntary burnt offering called עולה by the Torah, an offering of which the priests only receive the skin and hair of the animal. The burning of the fat parts of the animal or the parallel fistful of flour and oil of the gift offering מנחה, which is burnt on the altar, are the instruments that bring about this atonement for sinful thoughts. Obtaining forgiveness for sinful deeds (all of them committed inadvertently, of course) other parts of the bodies of the offerings presented as חטאת or אשם, “sin offering or guilt offering,” are required. Peace offerings, שלמים, on the other hand, are viewed (based on Tzefaniah 3,9) as if the owner joins, becomes a partner with the angels, he and they serving their Lord jointly.']"
Leviticus, 4,3,"['seeing that sinners are always on different levels morally and ethically, some being more prone to sin than others, the Torah addresses these different groups of people in different ways, each one appropriate to their specific rating in society. The Torah begins with the High Priest, the one who is least likely to commit a sin, and writes: אם הכהן המשיח יחטא לאשמת העם, implying that a sin by the High Priest is most likely the outcome of guilt by the people, their conduct having contributed to his committing such an error. The Talmud (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.34b.29"" data-ref=""Berakhot 34b:29"">Berachot 34b:29</a>) quotes that if someone makes an error in his private prayer this is a bad omen for him. If, however, the cantor, i.e. the person hired to pray on behalf of the people makes an error, not only he but all those on whose behalf he offered his prayers will suffer the consequences of his error. The sacrifice of a priest who committed an error must be burned and no one derives the slightest benefit from such an offering. Such considerations account for the fact that the Torah did not write here ואשם, “he sinned,” which would have been a warning for the errant person to do teshuvah. Had the Torah phrased its address to the High Priest thus this would not have been appropriate as the error committed by the High Priest did not originate within his heart but his faulty prayer had been due to the sinfulness of the people he represented which had insidiously influenced the words he was uttering.  ']"
Leviticus, 4,13,"['in the event the Supreme Court issued an erroneous decree, a very remote chance, ישגו ונעלם דבר מעיני הקהל, although this court is to function as עיני הקהל, “the watchful eye of the community,” not only did they fail to protect their community from sinning but they did not even succeed in preventing themselves from committing such an error. Nonetheless the Torah attributes such an error by the Supreme Court as ואשמו, “they sinned,” the “they” being the congregation which is held responsible if their “seeing eye” fails. The Torah here warns of the need to do teshuvah, i.e. all those concerned, before proceeding with the sacrifice, as the sacrifice would be useless unless all the people had confessed their errors. Seeing that the combined guilt of the Supreme Court and the people of their generation is severe, the blood of the atonement is sprinkled on the dividing curtain inside the sanctuary and the sin offering is burned up on the altar completely.\n']"
Leviticus, 4,22,"['אשר נשיא יחטא, when the King (or political head) sins; there is no conditional word אם, “if,” i.e. the Torah considers it as almost a given that the political head of the people will become guilty of at least an inadvertent sin. Moses describes such a likely scenario as the result of the people enjoying good times, when he says in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.15"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:15"">Deuteronomy 32,15</a> וישמן ישורון ויבעט, “when Yeshurun waxed fat it kicked. ואשם, he realised himself that he had sinned; it did not have to be brought to his attention by others. או הודע לו, or his sin had to be brought to his attention by others. The vowel cholem on the letter vav substitutes for the vowel shuruk which would have made it clear that it is a passive mode.\n']"
Leviticus, 4,27,"['ואם נפש אחת תחטא בשגגה מעם הארץ, if an ordinary citizen had committed an inadvertent sin, a likely event; here the Torah describes the sin as חטא, whereas when speaking of the King it describes it as אשם, in order to warn him at the same time to confess and do teshuvah before offering his sin offering. In both instances, as well as in all sacrifices described as asham, part of the sacrificial meat is eaten by the priests. The eating of those parts of the sacrifice by the priests is an essential ingredient in the atonement process for the guilty parties. ']"
Leviticus, 5,17,"['ואשם ונשא עונו, our sages have a tradition that the Torah here speaks of an asham taluy, a guilt offering offered while the exact nature of the guilt is unclear. The person offering it is not even sure that he is guilty of an offence. Considering this state of affairs the Torah writes ונשא עוונו, he carries (the burden) of his guilt. The guilt is not spelled out precisely as it is not yet known. He may not actually have committed a sin, but this does not mean that he is free from guilt as had he been careful he would never have been in the predicament of not knowing if he had committed the specific sin he is afraid he might have committed.\n']"
Leviticus, 5,19,"[""אשם הוא; even though sometimes this offering is brought when no offence has in fact been committed, the party bringing such an offering is not guilty of bringing secular meat into the holy precincts, for it is after all a קרבן, an approved offering. Even if the party concerned had not been guilty of the offence he thought he might have been guilty of, 'אשום אשם לה, he is certainly guilty before G’d for being careless enough for the doubt about his specific guilt in this instance to arise.""]"
Leviticus, 5,23,"['והשיב את הגזלה..ואת אשמו יביא, the sacrifice does not achieve atonement until the guilty party has first satisfied the demands on him by the injured party.']"
Leviticus, 6,2,"['צו את אהרן זאת תורת העולה, after the Torah had informed us about most of the sacrifices and how they were to be offered, the Torah now refers to the specific “Torah” pertaining to each of these voluntary burnt offerings. We pointed out already that different people who feel the need to offer this sacrifice are motivated by quite different considerations. The variety of sacrificial offerings provided for by the Torah corresponds roughly to the variety of human personalities and the considerations motivating their actions.  The Torah mentions as a salient feature of the burnt-offering, עולה, that the entire animal is offered on the altar for ריח ניחוח, “sweet smelling fragrance,” although only a small part of it is actually going up in flames. It is this small part which is truly the sacrifice called עולה. Further parts of that sacrifice (animal) [which burned to ash from the heat but did not go up in flames. Ed. ] are deposited אצל המזבח, next to the altar after having turned to ash. Those parts are referred to as דשן, containing a certain degree of moisture which gives the fire a chance to smolder within them. This is meant by the words אשר תאכל אותם האש את העולה, some of it, when completely turned to ash is removed outside the camp while the priest carrying same wears garments of a lower rank. Even though these ashes are just that, ash, the place they are being consigned to cannot be just any dump but must be a site described by the Torah as טהור, ritually pure. [A significant ingredient of this “Torah”, (call it symbolism if you will) of the Olah is the מוקד, the burning center of the altar. We do not find the expression in connection with the other sacrifices. Perhaps this is symbolic of the “rising” of the עולה heavenwards. Ed.]\n']"
Leviticus, 6,7,"['לפני המזבח, now the Torah explains the “Torah” of the gift-offering, מנחה, explaining that all of it is to be brought לפני המזבח “in front of the altar” as opposed to the Olah which was brought on the מוקד of the altar. All sacrifices are brought directly and exclusively to G’d. The parts allocated to the priests are not allocated by the owners of the sacrifice, but are to be viewed as G’d inviting the priests to be guests at His table, in Talmudic parlance as משלחן גבוה קא זכו, “they are benefiting from a table in the celestial regions.” The gift offering by a priest ends up on the altar completely as opposed to that of ordinary Israelites’ gift offering of which only a fistful gets to the altar, the balance being eaten by the priests.']"
Leviticus, 6,18,"['now the “Torah” of the sin offering, חטאת, is mentioned. If the sin offering is meant to atone for a serious sin, its blood has to offered in side the sanctuary, and none of the offering is allocated to the priests to eat. The parts normally eaten by the priests will also be burned.']"
Leviticus, 7,7,"['there is a common denominator between the chatat and the asham sacrifice. While the former atones for inadvertently committed sins for which the karet penalty would be in place if the sin had been committed deliberately, the asham, although not atoning for this kind of sin, does have a similar place in the pyramid of offerings, seeing the sin it atones for involves careless behaviour vis a vis matters that are holy, something that one needs to be more than usually careful about. Symbolically speaking, i.e. as to their “Torah,” they have much in common, תורה אחת.']"
Leviticus, 7,11,"['וזאת תורת זבח השלמים, here we are told that although the common denominator between these offerings is that they share the heading sh’lamim inasmuch as these offerings are categorized in the Talmud as קדשים קלים, ”holy things of a minor degree of sanctity,” there are differences, nuances between one type of such קדשים קלים and other types. For instance, if they involve thanksgiving the animals offerings are accompanied by breads, some of which are leavened. Granted that the underlying reason for the need to offer thanks is what our sages call the שאור שבעיסה, “the element of ego in the ‘dough,’” the aspiring human personality, by consisting predominantly of unleavened loaves this element becomes subordinate. [it must be remembered that basically, no other offering consisting of baked goods is allowed to be leavened. The author feels that if a person finds himself in an unexpectedly dangerous situation requiring a miracle to save him, this indicates that had his conduct been beyond reproach he would not first have become exposed to that danger. On a national rather than an individual level, the Purim story is an illustration of what the author means. Ed.] One of the reasons the Torah requires so many individual loaves of bread as part of the Todah sacrifice, is to enable as many people as possible to become aware of someone having been miraculously saved. The period during which these breads can be eaten is the same as the period  holy things of the higher order may be eaten, i.e. only one day and one night, not like ordinary sh’lamim which may be eaten two days and one night.\n']"
Leviticus, 7,15,['I just explained that ordinary sh’lamim may be eaten for two days and a night. ']
Leviticus, 7,19,"['Even though these offerings are of a subordinate level of sanctity, if the meat comes into contact with ritual impurity it is to be burned, and anyone eating thereof is guilty of the same karet penalty as if he had eaten from sacrificial meat of a higher level of sanctity that had become ritually defiled.']"
Leviticus, 7,30,"[""'ידיו תביאנה את אישי ה, seeing that the remainder of the animal belongs to the owners who had brought the offering, the owner together with the priest officiating on his behalf, presents this “waving” to G’d, this symbolic action indicating that basically the entire offering is G’d’s even if only the fat on the chest is offered on the altar, the chest itself belonging to the priest. The main reason for the “waving” is on account of that chest, to signal that actually it too belongs to G’d. There was no need to wave the fat, seeing we all know that the fat of every sacrificial animal always belongs to G’d via the altar on which it is burned up.""]"
Leviticus, 7,32,"['ואת שוק הימין תתנו תרומה לכהן, from the part which belongs to the owners; we may view the priest in this instance as similar to the King’s minister who, when someone who comes to offer a gift to the king, accepts a smaller gift meant for the king’s servant in order to secure an audience with the king by the person bearing the larger gift. ']"
Leviticus, 8,2,"['ואת פר החטאת ואת שני האילים, the bull as a sin offering is mentioned first, in accordance with the statement of our sages that whenever both a sin offering and a burnt offering have to be brought the sin offering is brought first. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Pesachim.59"" data-ref=""Pesachim 59"">Pessachim 59</a>) The reason is simple; how could the person offering the burnt offering expect it to be welcome in the eyes of G’d if he still required atonement for a sin in order to be in G’d’s good graces? David paraphrases this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.40.7"" data-ref=""Psalms 40:7"">Psalms 40,7</a> עולה וחטאת לא שאלת, “You do not ask for burnt offerings and sin offerings.” This bull became a “sin offering” after having been anointed, a procedure similar to the anointing of the High Priest for his office. However, in this instance the blood of this sin offering was not brought into the sanctuary, seeing that the sin of Aaron and his sons had not been of such a severity as would require this additional procedure. Severe errors by the High Priest are the ones listed in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.4.3"" data-ref=""Leviticus 4:3"">Leviticus 4,3</a> or 4,13 by the Supreme Court. Such errors require that the blood of their sin offerings be brought into the sanctuary itself. We explained all this at the appropriate place in chapter 16. The reason why the Torah first deals with the burnt-offering before dealing with the consecration offerings, is that there was an element of sin, i.e. need for forgiveness in connection with the burnt offering, as is evident from the Torah’s concluding remark ונרצה לו לכפר עליו, “and it shall become acceptable for him to atone for him.” (1,4). The reason why the Torah first deals with the burnt-offering before dealing with the consecration offerings, is that there was an element of sin, i.e. need for forgiveness in connection with the burnt offering, as is evident from the Torah’s concluding remark ונרצה לו לכפר עליו, “and it shall become acceptable for him to atone for him.” (1,4) whereas in all other שלמים offerings the priest receives the right thigh, in the case of the mandatory שלמים offering of the Nazir at the end of his term, the priest received both the right thigh and the foreleg, זרוע. As to the ram of the consecration offering שלמים, even the thigh is offered on the altar. When a non priest offers a שלמים, generally speaking, he will donate the thigh together with the lower leg, to the priest who enters inside the holy domain out of bounds to the owner of the sacrifice. The Nazir donates also the יד, i.e. the foreleg, symbolically handing the priest the work of his hands, which until the termination of the period of his vow as Nazir had all been dedicated to G’d.  On the other hand, the rites of the consecration offerings required that the offering itself was a preparatory offering enabling the priest henceforth to enter the holy domains of the Temple. To symbolise this the thigh was presented on the altar.']"
Leviticus, 8,35,"['יומם ולילה, for the curtains (carpets) were never dismantled, as we explained in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.40.18"" data-ref=""Exodus 40:18"">Exodus 40,18</a>.']"
Leviticus, 9,4,"['כי היום ה\' נראה אליכם, it had already become manifest as an appreciation of their handiwork when we read that the Presence (glory) of the Lord filled the Tabernacle (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.40.34"" data-ref=""Exodus 40:34"">Exodus 40,34</a>). It is therefore no more than appropriate that you express your appreciation of this by this sacrifice.']"
Leviticus, 9,6,"[""זה הדבר אשר צוה ה' חעשו, to place the weight of your body with your hands on the sin offering as well as on the burnt offering intended on behalf of the congregation.

The Torah had stipulated that no foreign incense [nor other unauthorised offerings. Ed.] was to be offered on that altar (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.30.9"" data-ref=""Exodus 30:9"">Exodus 30,9</a>). Even assuming that the golden altar would qualify for additional incense offerings when a specific command to do so would be issued, the sons of Aaron sinned by doing this now and not having consulted with their mentors. This is why the Torah stresses', 'אשר לא צוה אותם, “which He had not commanded them (to do).”']"

Leviticus, 10,10,"['ולהבדיל..ולהורות.

Solomon, in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.31.4-5"" data-ref=""Proverbs 31:4-5"">Proverbs 31,4-5</a> is similarly critical of such a practice writing: “wine is not for kings, O Lemuel; not for kings to drink, nor any strong drink for princes, lest they drink and forget what has been ordained.”']"
Leviticus, 10,15,"['יביאו להניף...והיה לך ולבניך, you will not be able to claim these until after the waving has been performed. In other words, this is not a “kick back” from G’d’s “Table.”']"

Leviticus, 10,19,"['הן היום הקריבו, a construction similar to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.3.1"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 3:1"">Jeremiah 3,1</a> הן ישלח איש את אשתו, “if a man divorces his wife, etc.” Or, Chagai 2,12 הן ישא איש בשר קודש, “if a man is carrying sacrificial flesh…and his garment touches bread,   will the latter become holy?” Aaron’s reasoning goes as follows: “if the subject matter had merely been that these sons of mine had offered mandatory sin offerings, and burnt offerings which were of a voluntary category, even though they would not constitute mandatory public offerings in the future, and we had consumed the meat of these sacrifices today being in the state of aninut pre-mourning, that we are in, would this have been pleasing to the Lord?” Is it not an ironclad rule that the eating of sacrificial meat deliberately while in such a “hybrid” ritual state will not advance the atonement sought for? In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.26.14"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 26:14"">Deuteronomy 26,14</a> we learn that it is forbidden to consume such sacrificial meat of offerings of the second degree of sanctity, קדשים קלים. Aaron argues that notwithstanding the fact that he was ordered to consume the remains of the minchah offering which was only a one time offering, such a rule did not apply to sacrifices which are part of the regular Temple service.\n']"
Leviticus, 10,20,"['וייטב בעיניו, Moses enjoyed the reasoning Aaron presented explaining why he had acted as he did and he accepted his interpretation of the law. He complimented both him and his sons.']"
Leviticus, 11,2,"['זאת החיה אשר תאכלו, after the Israelites had divested themselves of their spiritual jewelry which they had acquired at Mount Sinai when receiving the Torah, something which if they had been able to retain it, would have given them direct access to the Shechinah without the need for an intermediary, as stated by G’d in the wordsבכל המקום אשר אזכיר את שמי אבא אליך וברכתיך, “in any place where I hear My name mentioned I will come to you and bless you, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.24"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:24"">Exodus 20,24</a>) a change had now occurred due to the people’s sin at the golden calf. G’d stated that the purpose of the Tabernacle was for Him to take up residence therein so that His essence should not feel disgust at the Jewish people. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.26.11"" data-ref=""Leviticus 26:11"">Leviticus 26,11</a>). Unfortunately, the golden calf episode had brought about a cardinal change in G’d’s relationship with the people so that He would not allow His Presence to dwell among them even briefly, refused to accompany them on their journey (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:3"">Exodus 33,3</a>) By means of his lengthy prayers Moses accomplished some improvement in this relationship of G’d to the Israelites by means of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, the priests  performing service there, etc. Finally, the people attained the state of grace described as וירא כבוד ה\' אל כל העם, “the glory of the Lord appeared to the whole people.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.9.23"" data-ref=""Leviticus 9:23"">Leviticus 9,23</a>.) This manifestation of the “glory of the Lord” was the descent of fire from heaven to devour the offerings of the people in the Tabernacle. A way had now been found to refine the character of the people in attitudes and by application of their intelligence so that they would qualify for eternal life (life after death of the body). The method chosen for this was the refinement of the foods eaten by the people. G’d forbade consumption of the kinds of foodstuffs which exert –over a period of time- a negative influence on the people’s character and their intelligence. This is spelled out by the Torah in verse 43 of our chapter where the rationale of the legislation is אל תשקצו בנפשותיכם, another way of saying “do not contaminate your souls.” This is only the effect of observing the negative commandment not to eat forbidden things. There is a positive aspect to this legislation also called והתקדשתם והייתם קדושים “if you will sanctify yourselves you will remain holy.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.15.31"" data-ref=""Leviticus 15:31"">Leviticus 15,31</a>). When G’d added כי קדוש אני, this was an incentive to attain the dimension of eternal life similar to G’d. In addition to legislation involving our physical foodstuffs, the Torah introduced legislation designed to refine our body’s other appetites, that of the libido. Legislation governing a husband’s marital relation with a woman who is a menstruant, or who suffers diseases of her sexual organs, or experiencing childbirth (נדה, זבה, יולדת) are intended to sanctify human sperm and to cleanse if from all spiritual contamination, טומאת הגוף. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.15.31"" data-ref=""Leviticus 15:31"">Leviticus 15,31</a> והזהרתם את בני ישראל מטומאתם, “caution the Children of Israel to abstain from their pollutants.” If they would fail to do so they would forfeit this claim to eternal life. Here the Torah introduces this subject of ritual impurity in connection with animals. In this whole paragraph “defilement” is brought about either by direct touch, indirect touch such a carrying or moving the object by pushing it. Only such animals a are liable to confer contamination of our souls are capable of conferring immediate ritual impurity. Fish, birds, locusts and other creeping things are not capable of conferring such ritual contamination of a person by means of contact other than by means of ingesting them.. The Torah uses the expression שיקוץ to describe their negative fallout when dead instead of the expression טומאה. (compare verse 10,13, 41-42) to describe the negative result if we were to eat such creatures.\n']"
Leviticus, 11,43,"[""ולא תטמאו בהם כי אני ה' אלוקיכם והתקדשתם, do not contaminate yourselves in a manner that will make this contamination really serious, i.e. by eating these creatures or parts of them. Seeing that I am your G’d I desire you to sanctify yourselves so that you will be in a state capable of absorbing holiness on an ongoing basis.""]"
Leviticus, 11,44,"['והייתם קדושים כי קדוש אני, so that your holiness will endure indefinitely. The reason why I desire this is because I am holy, and I would like you to become as close to My own essence as it is possible for a creature to become. All of this you will be able to achieve by adhering strictly to the legislation governing what you may eat and what you must eschew. Our sages paraphrased the result of observing this legislation in the following words: “when man sanctifies himself a little, the additional amount of sanctity supplied for him from the heavenly regions is many more times this.” (Yuma 39). ']"
Leviticus, 11,45,"[""כי אני ה' המעלה אתכם מארץ מצרים להיות לכם לאלוקים.  It is no more than appropriate that you do all this in order to attain this level of holiness in order to carry out My will; for indeed when I took you out of Egypt this was expressly in order for you to achieve this spiritual level and for Me to be your G’d, a G’d to Whom you could relate directly without any intermediary. You are meant to be holy forever by emulating My attributes and My way of thinking, in other words, you are to emulate that part of Me which I describe as קדוש, holy, beyond compare.""]"
Leviticus, 11,46,"['זאת תורת הבהמה והעוף, this is the underlying motivation of the regulations governing the prohibitions affecting forbidden foods mentioned earlier.']"
Leviticus, 12,2,"['אשה כי תזריע וילדה זכר, the sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Niddah.31"" data-ref=""Niddah 31"">Niddah 31</a> explain the term תזריע in our verse as “when a woman experiences her orgasm before her male partner the child born from such a union will be a male. The perception underlying this is that the woman’s “seed” is the moisture which she excretes from time to time at the time she engages in physical union with her partner does not enter into the formation of a male embryo. Her “semen” is active in suppressing the effect of the man’s semen. But her blood enters the semen of the male it moistens and provides addition impetus to the man’s semen,', 'כימי נדבת דותה, for during the first seven days after her giving birth she is like a menstruating woman regarding  her ritual status.\n']"
Leviticus, 12,3,"['וביום השמיני ימול, for by that time the blood of his mother has congealed [dry blood does not confer impurity. Ed.] As a result the baby has become ritually cleansed, no moist blood being attached to it.']"
Leviticus, 12,4,"['בדמי טהרה, although this blood could not have originated from a new ovulation but dates back to the last ovulation before she had become pregnant, whatever had happened at that time is no longer relevant the whole appearance of that blood having changed completely.']"
Leviticus, 12,8,"['וכפר עליה, for during all the days that she had been excreting blood her thoughts had been preoccupied with the phenomenon of semen, etc, and she had therefore not been in a fit state of mind to enter the precincts of the Temple and offer sacred matters.']"
Leviticus, 13,2,"['אדם כי יהיה בעור בשרו, generally, such phenomena occur when one did not purify oneself from the effects of having had sexual relations or direct contact with the seed of a menstruating woman.', 'שאת או ספחת או בהרת, different skin afflictions, the common denominator being that they are of different shades of white. We base ourselves on the oral tradition as spelled out in Nega-im 1,1. None of these phenomena correspond to the skin diseases we read about in medical text books. Such phenomena as are mentioned in these textbooks do not result in the afflicted person being considered ritually impure, nor are they subject to the priest deciding if indeed the symptoms require isolation of the afflicted person and when such symptoms can be declared as having disappeared.  According to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Berakhot.5"" data-ref=""Berakhot 5"">Berachot 5</a> the only skin afflictions which may be viewed as G’d’s reminder to improve our lifestyle are the four kinds mentioned in our chapter. While they are not classified as afflictions revealing G’d’s love for the person thus afflicted, they are however, described as מזבח כפרה, as “an altar serving as stepping stone to atonement for the character weakness that the afflicted person has to overcome.” G’d does not employ any other medically well known skin diseases as His instrument to call us to order for various sins committed. והובא, anyone who goes to a place to be attended to is not referred to as “coming,” בא, but as being brought, i.e. הובא.  Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.45.15"" data-ref=""Psalms 45:15"">Psalms 45,15</a>. The passive mode of the transitive form והגישו אדוניו in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.21.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 21:6"">Exodus 21,6</a> is ונגשו אל המשפט, “he his being brought to.” ']"
Leviticus, 13,3,"['נגע צרעת היא. The Torah repeats this same expression twice in successive verses, and also the expression צרעת היא is repeated both in verse 8 and verse 11. Sometimes, as here and as in verse 22, the word נגע is added. The reason may be that this affliction, in common with other afflictions, is something that develops in stages. Just as the affliction intensifies gradually in its early stages, so it gradually becomes weaker on the way to healing. When it is already a long-standing affliction it is referred to as צרעת יושנת, whereas when it is in its opening stages it is called simply נגע. When it is a fully fledged affliction it is called נגע צרעת. When it is in the process of waning it is already referred to as נרפא הצרעת, an affliction which has healed. When it has healed completely it is referred to as נרפא הנתק. Seeing that this type of affliction is perceived as a warning signal from G’d to the individual experiencing it, i.e. he is reminded to get rid of negative characteristics, the Talmud refers to it as מזבח כפרה “an altar serving as atonement.” The period of isolation serves to remind the afflicted person to review what he may have been guilty of. This concept has been spelled out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.36.10"" data-ref=""Job 36:10"">Job 36,10</a> as ויגל אותם למוסר ויאמר כי ישובון מאון, “He opens their understanding by discipline, and orders them back from mischief.”']"
Leviticus, 13,4,"['ועמוק אין מראה מן העור, even though the sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shevuot.6"" data-ref=""Shevuot 6"">Shevuot 6</a>) have said that everything which looks white is described a looking deep, recessed, as the sun appears as if deeper than the shadow, so that the wording of our verse appears to be incompatible with the statement of the sages, seeing that the skin itself is a form of something whitish the Torah means that the relationship of the normal skin to the whiteness of the tzoraat is comparable to the appearance of the shadow to the sun. [a spot of shadow on a bright day, is after all not “black” as is the darkness of the night. In fact, compared to the darkness of the night, it might be viewed as a weak “white.” Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 13,5,"['וראהו הכהן, it is a decree by the Torah that only a priest is qualified to determine what is ritually pure and what is ritually impure in all matters pertaining to these skin afflictions. The prophet Maleachi 2,7 echoes this concept when he says that כי שפתי כהן ישמרו דת, “that the lips (pronouncements) of the priest will preserve the Jewish religion.” The priest is also required to counsel the afflicted person to examine his lifestyle so that he himself will become the key to his rehabilitation. At the same time the Priest will add his own prayer when asking G’d to heal the afflicted. Apart from his prayer his expertise will tell him when the stage has been reached when the affliction has waned so that the count toward rehabilitation and the presentation of offerings can begin.']"
Leviticus, 13,19,"['והיה במקום השחין שאת לבנה, this spot is not being judged by the same criteria as listed earlier which were inflammations of skin on the flesh; similarly, inflammations caused by fire burning the skin. When ordinary שחין destroys the tissue on top of the skin it never grows back to look as it did originally. What grows on the afflicted area is tissue which resembles the original skin, so that no skin graft is needed. Original skin is medically irreplaceable. [opinions in those days.] When someone suffers from a נגע צרעת the skin, when healed, looks indistinguishable from the original.']"
Leviticus, 13,30,"['נתק, a skin affliction in a part of the skin normally covered with hair is called a נתק. The word implies that the affliction uproots the hair follicles with the hair. This hair was not pulled out by human hands or by some kind of chemical or medication. The fact that some black hair remains in the skin proves that notwithstanding the other symptoms suggesting that the person suffering the affliction is ritually impure, the black hair’s presence saves him from such a determination by the priest.']"
Leviticus, 13,39,"['כהות לבנות, below that which appears like the skin of an egg concerning which the sages taught us  (Maimonides Tum’at Tzoraat 1,11']"
Leviticus, 13,47,"['והבגד כי יהיה בו נגע צרעת, when it is quite clear that this is not the kind of stain familiar to science and responsive to removing by chemical detergents. Discolouration of a garment in colours other than the ones that are work related due to the vocation of the wearer, are usually caused deliberately by the owner. What occurred here is due to some sin the owner was guilty of. <br> At any rate, our tradition has taught that the only discolouration of garments or cloths that are considered from a halachic point of view are garments which themselves are white and not coloured. Any coloured garment is not subject to this legislation at all, is not within the parameter of what is called נגע צרעת. The phenomenon of white garments or exterior walls of houses which are normally whitewashed breaking out in different colours is by itself a warning to the owner to examine his lifestyle and what he might have done wrong to rate such a warning. <br> Our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.20"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 20"">Kidushin 20</a> tell about how seriously a violation of a rule which is only peripheral to the Sh’mittah legislation is viewed. [the basic rules of sh’mittah relate to working the soil during that year. What I described here as “peripheral,” i.e. in Talmudic parlance as אבקה של שמטה, is the dealing in produce grown in violation of the sh’mittah laws. Ed.] The Talmud explains that violating the “peripheral” aspects of that legislation my result in the guilty party becoming impoverished. The process is gradual so that the guilty party had ample opportunity to ask himself why G’d had singled him out for this kind of punishment.<br> The same is true of the נגע צרעת  legislation. Proof of the fact that this affliction is due to a well meaning Creator, One Who is concerned with the welfare of His Jewish subjects, is the fact that if the symptoms we know as נגע צרעת surface on the garments of gentile or houses of gentiles, these are not declared as ritually impure. Seeing that the gentiles as a rule do not have life in the hereafter to look forward to, G’d is not at such pains to warn them not to risk losing something they doe not to look forward to in any event. When a Jew is in danger of losing his claim to eternal life this is a far more serious matter, and G’d goes out of His way to afford the person potentially endangering his claim to eternal life an opportunity to repent and change his lifestyle before it is too late. In referring to this concept, Solomon in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.10.25"" data-ref=""Proverbs 10:25"">Proverbs 10,25</a> describes the צדיק, the Just, as the foundation of the universe. The whole idea of man having been created in G’d’s image, and G’d’s desire for man to become as much like Him as it is possible for a creature to become, lies at the source of this concern by G’d not to let man waste his opportunity to live up to his destiny. <br> Once man becomes aware of G’d’s concern for him he will have little difficulty in making his own will correspond to the revealed will of His Maker. He will begin to realise that by “listening” to the urgings of his body-dominated desires he risks losing his eternal life and the death of his body would also signal the death of his life force נפש, just as that of all the animals. &gt;br&gt; Even though we see many people defy G’d in their lifestyles, we can be sure in the words of G’d in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:7"">Exodus 23,7</a> כי לא אצדיק רשע, “that I will not allow the wicked to appear as if he were a just person for ever.” [the author, in continuing this sermon, describes all the gentiles and most of the Jews of his time, as so oblivious to all this that they may be compared as existing in a permanent state of spiritual coma. Ed.] Nonetheless, if G’d chose the Jewish people as His special people it is because He entertains the fond hope that out of this nation there will emerge a nucleus of people who are aware of their destiny. When the Jewish people are predominantly in the state of spiritual coma the author just described, the symptoms described in our portion will not appear as it would be a waste of time to hope that the people thus afflicted would see in these symptoms a message from their G’d.']"
Leviticus, 14,2,"['והובא אל הכהן, to a site near the boundary of the encampment where the priest can come to inspect the afflicted person easily without having to subject himself to special effort.']"
Leviticus, 14,7,"['וטהרו, similar as in 13,45 פרימה ופריעה, baring something, tearing it, removing the offending part.']"
Leviticus, 14,8,"['ורחץ במים וטהר, part of the general theme “he will make his residence outside the camp” (as long as he is afflicted) (compare 13,46)']"

Leviticus, 14,12,"['והקריב אותו לאשם.  It has already been explained in 7,1 as well as in my commentary on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:2"">Leviticus 1,2</a> that the guilt offering, אשם in the main applies to inadvertent sins committed involving misuse of sacred matters, or misuse of the sacred domain of the Temple, such as unauthorised persons entering it, or ritually unclean persons entering it, etc. Just as in the case of the sin offering, חטאת, if that sin had been committed deliberately it would have resulted in the karet penalty, and if not atoned for through teshuvah would have resulted in the guilty person’s eternally being cut off from the collective soul of the Jewish people. <br>Our sages in Erchin 15 and 16 have already stated that the principal sins for which a person is afflicted with the נגע צרעת, are bad-mouthing people and haughtiness, both of which are perceived by the sages as direct trespass against G’d’s Holiness. Even though badmouthing is generally perpetrated in secret not affording the victim a chance to defend himself against the accusation and character assassination, the prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.29.15"" data-ref=""Isaiah 29:15"">Isaiah 29,15</a> views it as the perpetrators saying “who sees us, who takes note of us?” In other words, the prophet considers the “secrecy” as worse than the sin itself, as it suggests that G’d is unable to see it, and therefore represents a gross insult directed at G’d.<br> Concerning arrogant, haughty behaviour. We read in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.101.5"" data-ref=""Psalms 101:5"">Psalms 101,5</a> “He who slanders his friend in secret I will destroy; I cannot endure the haughty and proud man.” G’d is portrayed as if the sinner is “trying to steal part of G’d’s “clothing.” G’d declares that such people cannot co-exist with Him in the same universe. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.5"" data-ref=""Sotah 5"">Sotah 5</a>).<br> We have evidence in our scriptures (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Chronicles.26.16-19"" data-ref=""II Chronicles 26:16-19"">Chronicles II 26, 16-19</a>) that King Uzziah’s arrogance was punished with tzoraat for his haughtiness, as this sin was considered a trespass against G’d Himself.\n']"
Leviticus, 14,20,"['וכפר עליו הכן וטהר, he will have attained a sufficient level of ritual purity to be allowed to partake in sacrificial meats, and entering holy precincts (if he is otherwise qualified to do so). Compare our sages in Negai-im 14,3 that “as soon as he has brought his atonement offering he is free to again partake of sacred foods.” (the portions of the peace-offerings normally consumed by the owners of the animals.)']"
Leviticus, 14,36,"['ופנו את הבית בטרם יבא, they can clear out the house before the priest’s arrival. In fact, that priest is warned not to arrive until all valuables have been cleared out of the house. During the time that this takes place the owners will be able to do teshuvah and pray and synchronise their prayer with that of the priest when he arrives. Simultaneous to this the priest will announce the period of isolation. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Vayikra_Rabbah.17.7"" data-ref=""Vayikra Rabbah 17:7"">Vayikra Rabbah 17,7</a> we are told that our paragraph is an allusion to the eventual destruction of the first Temple, its rebuilding, as well as the destruction of the second Temple. The word וטהרו in our verse alludes to the ultimate rebuilding of the third Temple, this one not to be destroyed again.\n']"
Leviticus, 14,54,"['זאת התורה, if someone wants to qualify to issue religious rulings concerning the subject of negai-im he must first of all be able to distinguish between two different types of such afflictions although they both belong to basically the same category. This is the meaning of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.17.8"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 17:8"">Deuteronomy 17,8</a> בין נגע לנגע, “between one kind of nega and another kind of nega.”', 'לכל נגע הצרעת ולנתק. Even though both these afflictions are known as a skin affliction on the skin of a human being they are distinctly different from one another. The נתק is not judged by appearances but by the behaviour of the hair surrounding it, whereas the ordinary nega tzoraat is judged by changes in its colouration, etc.\n']"
Leviticus, 14,55,"['ולצרעת הבגד והבית, even though both these phenomena maybe very similar in its greenish or reddish appearance, and both are unnatural phenomena they are still different from one another in the following manner: If the coloured scab on the garment expanded after the first week of isolation the entire garment must be burned. If something parallel happens with the scab on the walls of the house at the end of the first week of isolation it is removed, whitewashed over and the priest waits for another week before arriving at a final disposition, i.e. if the symptoms are not on the wane the house will have to be destroyed.\n']"
Leviticus, 14,56,"['ולשאת ולספחת ולבהרת, even though the common denominator of these three skin eczemas is that all of them are a shade of white, and that the rules applying to them are basically similar, so much so that they can be treated as cumulative, as we know from tradition (negai-im 1,3) anyone who undertakes to rule on these matters has to be an expert in all the different shadings of white, and where these are most likely to surface. The areas in which shechin or michveh, (burnt like appearance) are judged by a combination of appearances., whereas tzarevet and the areas where hair grows are not judged by appearances at all.']"
Leviticus, 14,57,"['זאת תורת הצרעת, one is not to add and impose more stringent rules also declaring similar looking skin eczemas as conferring ritual impurity. [the author interprets the word זאת, this, as restrictive, i.e. “this and none other.” Ed.] Granted that there are numerous other skin diseases which in some respects resemble the ones mentioned in the Torah, it is not in order to apply what the sages normally do to protect a person from inadvertently running afoul one of G’d’s commandments. In the domain of negai-im the rule postulated by Solomon in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.30.6"" data-ref=""Proverbs 30:6"">Proverbs 30,6</a> אל תוסף על דבריו, “do not add anything to G’d’s words” is strictly adhered to. One factor which indicates how wrong it would be to do this is that the Torah herself declares the “worst” phenomenon of skin eczema, i.e. the whole skin being affected totally, as one that leaves the afflicted party ritually pure. [Naturally, such a person, in the process of being cured will experience part of his skin being afflicted, at which point the priest will have to declare him as impure. Ed.] The apparent lack of logic in this part of the legislation was the cue for the sages not to impose “protective fences” around this legislation.\n']"
Leviticus, 15,2,"['זב מבשרו, the Talmud K’ritut 8 already explained the preposition מ in the word מבשרו as meaning “emanating from,” and not as “due to, on account of.” The word בשר refers to the male organ. In other words, unless the symptoms described here are due to a local physiological imbalance and not as a secondary effect of some other primary cause such as overeating, for instance, these symptoms will not result in and confer ritual impurity. <br>Our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Niddah.35"" data-ref=""Niddah 35"">Niddah 35</a> already explained that the symptom called זוב is very similar in appearance to the albumen in an egg which has become rotten. When the cause is directly connected to the male organs of the afflicted person the legislation under discussion in this chapter applies. This is the meaning of the word מבשרו, a disturbance in the male organ to function properly. The author speculates that the cause may be overly frequent indulgence in the sex act, which in turns leads to insufficient time for the seminal fluid being replaced properly, etc. If that were the cause, a cause brought about by fantasizing about the sex act too often, the remedy, in part, would be the seven days during which the afflicted person counts towards his being healed, reflecting on the part his lifestyle played in causing the symptoms from which he suffered. By indulging in fewer sexual fantasies and the need to offer a sin offering after being free from these symptoms the afflicted person my be on the way to spiritual rehabilitation also. These thoughts are reflected in the Talmud on the folios we referred to.\n']"
Leviticus, 15,18,"['ואשה אשר ישכב איש אותה note that the Torah does not write איש כי ישכב את אשה, “when a man sleeps with a woman,” which is the Torah’s normal way of introducing such subjects, i.e. emphasizing the predominating role of the male in the sexual union. The reason for this change in syntax is to teach that unless the colour of the fluid originating in her vagina is reddish it does not confer ritual impurity. The only time the whitish seminal excretion of a woman confers ritual impurity on her male partner is when the man initiates the customary sexual union with her even if the seminal fluid remains in בית הסתרים “hidden” parts within the orifices of the woman, has not seen the light of day.\n']"
Leviticus, 15,19,"['ואשה כי תהיה זבה דם, here the Torah teaches rules concerning the menstruating woman and the one afflicted with untimely discharges from her vagina, stating that purification of the latter requires two offerings, a sin offering and a burnt offering. The Torah testifies by the nature of the offerings required that the disease described “does not come out of the blue,” but was the result of improper thoughts or even improper actions which preceded it. <br>Original woman who was punished for her sin was not only punished for eating from the tree of knowledge, but for the thoughts which ran through her mind prior to translating sinful thought into sinful action. We believe that this is reflected in the wording of the punishment הרבה ארבה עצבונך, “I will greatly multiply your discomfort” (during pregnancy and giving birth) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.3.16"" data-ref=""Genesis 3:16"">Genesis 3,16</a>) The punishment fitted the crime which was not something that was the result of a sudden impulse. The seven days until purification from the date of the end of the state of zavah is achieved, gives her time to reflect and to think pure thoughts as opposed to the time she had originally spent before violating G’d’s commandment not to eat from that tree. When the proper thoughts course through her mind during these seven days called appropriately שבעה נקיים, seven days of purification, her mind and not only her body will have been cleansed from improper attitudes so that the ritual immersion cleanses both body and mind. When this is the case, the two offerings required by the zavah will bring her the atonement for previous misdemeanours both in thought and in action. The sin offering atones for sinful action, the burnt offering for forbidden thoughts.\n']"
Leviticus, 15,32,"['זאת תורת הזב, the following considerations dealing with our subject need to be kept in mind: 1) seeing that the male afflicted with the discharge in question is required to bring a sin offering at the termination of the healing process teaches that the affliction was due to sin both in deed and in thought.<br> 2)  ואשר תצא ממנו שכבת זרע לטמאה בה the fact that ejaculation of seminal fluid by a man results in his becoming ritually impure is due to the contamination of man the species by the original serpent, for ever since the original sin seminal ejaculation has been used for physical gratification also, not only for the function allocated to it by G’d, propagation of the species. Had it not been for the serpent’s seduction of Eve, nothing spiritually negative would have become part of the act of ejaculating seminal fluids. ']"
Leviticus, 15,33,"['והדוה בנדתה, the word דוה alludes to something sinful, hence she became ritually defiled.', 'והזב, the thoughts we must entertain when studying this subject is that we must reflect on the original sin.', 'את זובו לזכר ולנקבה, at this point we must consider the difference between the legislation governing a man’s involuntary seminal-like ejaculation, and that of a woman. A woman’s discharge confers impurity only if it is reddish, whereas the parallel discharge by a male confers impurity only if it is not reddish.', 'ולאיש אשר ישכב עם טמאה, here we also have to reflect on the subject of a man deliberately indulging in sexual intercourse with a ritually contaminated woman. The Torah had written (verse 24) ותהי נדתה עליו, “her state of menstrual separation will apply to him.” There is no parallel verse describing such a result as due to a ritually pure woman sleeping with a man who was a zav at the time. [the ritual impurity of the zav was induced by a diseased body, as opposed to menstruation which is a natural state ever since the original sin. Ed.] There appears to be a dichotomy there. The Torah teaches that when a man is violating sexual mores he causes more spiritually negative fallout to himself than when a woman does the same thing in reverse. At least, there appears to be a difference between sickness induced by individual sin, such as zav and zavah as well as in the case of tzoraat, which we explained as also a sickness due to individual sin, not to the spiritual state of man, the species, since the original sin. This is why voluntary carnal association with the menstruant woman is a greater sin than voluntary carnal association with zav or zavah.\n']"
Leviticus, 16,1,"['וידבר ה\' אל משה אחרי מות, normally, the expression וידבר in the Holy Tongue is not used to describe specific parts of the verbal message but applies to the entire speech, characterising its nature. This is the reason why we find so many times the word לאמור, i.e. אמירה after the introduction וידבר. This is why verse 2 continues with ויאמר אליו דבר אל אהרן אחיך, He said to him: “say to your brother Aaron,” without a change of subject between the two verses. Seeing that the thrust of the message, i.e. its being connected to the immediately preceding death of the two sons of Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, had not changed, there was no need to once again identity the speaker, i.e. G’d, by adding the words ויאמר אליו, “He said to him,” as is customary in similar constructions in the Torah. However, according to a minority of our sages (Torat Kohanim 1,3) there were two separate addresses by G’d and we would then have to understand the verse as follows: one concerned the prohibition for Aaron not to enter the sanctuary any time he felt like it otherwise he would be courting death. The second time was after Aaron’s sons had died; Aaron was to enter only at G’d’s command. The warning this time was more urgent, warning that G’d’s presence in the sanctuary would be visible from the outside by means of the cloud hovering over the Tabernacle. At that point the voice of G’d addressed itself to Moses again, issuing instructions concerning the conduct of prophets and High priests in future generations. We find a reference to such matters in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.3.3-4"" data-ref=""I Samuel 3:3-4"">Samuel I 3,3-4</a> where Samuel is reported as lying down in the sanctuary of the Lord when G’d called to him.']"
Leviticus, 16,3,"['בזאת יבא...בפר בן בקר, by sanctifying the bull as a sin offering, and the ram as a burnt offering, and by donning the appropriate priestly garments, the linen ones which had no decorative additions and consisted only of white linen. On the one hand, that High Priest was not to enter the sanctuary until after the burnt offering had been sacrificed, but he was allowed to enter for the purpose of offering the incense as soon as the sin offering had been slaughtered.']"
Leviticus, 16,4,"['בגדי קדש הם, when angels appeared in human guise to the prophets they wore these kinds of garments. This is the meaning of the expression לבושי הבדים.

Leviticus, 16,5,"['שני שעירי עזים לחטאת, the first to atone for sins which occurred inadvertently in the holy precincts, and the second one in respect of sins committed by the public at large who through mostly being in a state of ritual impurity would not have been in a position to offer this sacrifice on their own behalf at this time. Had they done so while in a state of ritual impurity and had entered holy precincts, they would have conferred ritual impurity on their agent the priest. [just as happened with the scape-goat who conferred ritual impurity on the man leading it to its death. (verse 26). However, in this case such impurity was not conferred on sacred ground. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 16,8,"['גורלות, use of a lot, especially when handled by one of G’d’s intimates, in this case by Aaron, serves to confirm something G’d wants as we know from Solomon in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.16.33"" data-ref=""Proverbs 16:33"">Proverbs 16,33</a> בחיק יוטל את הגורל, ומה\' כל משפטו, “the lot is cast in the lap, but one’s judgment depends on G.d.” [the gullible person imagining that as long as the lot has not revealed what it was meant to reveal the fate of the individual has not been determined, is in gross error. The fate had long ago been determined in heaven. (Alshich). Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 16,9,"['ועשהו חטאת, the lot determines which of the male goats is to be the sin offering for the altar. In the words of our sages (Yuma 40) “the lot determines which is the sin offering, and not the name.” [calling it such is meaningless unless confirmed by the lot drawn. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 16,11,"['וכפר בעדו, we have already learned by tradition that both the atonements which are mentioned in connection with Aaron personally refer to the confession recited by Aaron, this is why they took place before the actual slaughtering of the sin offering.']"
Leviticus, 16,12,"['ולקח מלא המחתה, as soon as the sin offering had been slaughtered and he had previously recited his confession so that his sins had been removed, he was now ready to face the “King,” (G’d) who would look upon him with favour. This is what was meant in verse 2 with the reference to the cloud by means of which G’d would manifest Himself. At that point it was appropriate to honour Him by presenting the incense, much as the incense would be offered daily after the presentation of the daily communal offering, תמיד both in the morning and in the evening. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.29.42"" data-ref=""Exodus 29:42"">Exodus 29,42</a> עולת תמיד לדורותיכם פתח אהל מועד אשר אועד לכם שמה, “a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting where I manifest Myself for you.”']"
Leviticus, 16,15,"['החטאת אשר לעם. After he had completed offering the sin offering for his own atonement, also the people would be on the level where they could face the “King.” The sequence described here which at fist glance might seem as if the High Priest were more concerned with his own atonement than that of the people whom he represented, is confirmed by the prophet (Tzefaniah 2,1) in the words  התקוששו וקושו, which is interpreted in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.18"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 18"">Sanhedrin 18</a> as “attend to your own integrity before you attend to the integrity of others.”']"
Leviticus, 16,23,"['והניחם שם, for he had offered them in the presence of G’d so that they attained additional sanctity, and it is not appropriate even for the High Priest to wear them after they had performed the assigned task. (according to Yuma 12 these garments are buried forthwith or otherwise locked away.)']"
Leviticus, 16,24,"['ורחץ את בשרו, after he had supported his hands on the scape-goat. ועשה את עולתו, this was after he had first obtained his personal atonement, followed by the atonement on behalf of the people at large with the two sin offerings consisting of the male goats. Even the “scape-goat” is referred to here as a “sin offering,” חטאת, when we consider it had already been referred to as such in verse 5 where the Torah spoke about שני שעירי עזים לחטאת, “two male goats as sin offering.” Both of these procedures had to take place before the burnt offering on behalf of the people was offered. This was standard procedure, i.e. that the sin offering preceded the burnt offering. This point has been made in Pessachim 59.', 'וכפר בעדו ובעד העם, the atonement required for inappropriate thoughts which ought to precede matters requiring “clean” (sin free) hands and a pure heart. Such a sin free state is achieved by means of the burnt offering.\n']"
Leviticus, 16,29,"['לחקת עולם, even though G’d had provided a Temple wherein to perform the ritual called עבודה, sacrificial service, the Day of Atonement, in order to be fully effective, also requires that each person abstain from the kind of work forbidden on every Sabbath, as well as that he abstain from eating and drinking, i.e. עינוי.']"
Leviticus, 16,30,"['כי ביום הזה יכפר, the reason why the other factors mentioned just now are required in addition to the sacrificial service is that if the entire load of achieving atonement were to be placed on the shoulders of the High Priest this would amount only to “downgrading” of the seriousness of the sins which is what the term of כיפור is all about. The individual must prepare himself mentally for obtaining forgiveness from his Maker by these additional measures.', ""לפני ה' תטהרו, absolute forgiveness, rehabilitation, can occur only in the presence of the Lord, which in turn can be achieved only by personal confession of one’s sin and one’s absolute undertaking not to commit such sins again in similar circumstances. The verse is introduced here to remind us that only the Lord Himself is aware of the sincerity of one’s teshuvah, one’s repentance.""]"
Leviticus, 16,31,"['In order to make this point even clearer the Torah wrote concerning this Day of Atonement, שבת שבתון היא לכם, this refers to the uniqueness of this day. A Sabbath day is usually honoured with food and drink, whereas the abstaining from physical indulgences i.e. a צום, fast day, is meant to put us in the good graces of G’d. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.58.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 58:3"">Isaiah 58,3</a>) The message here is phrased differently but is the same. The self-denial of the Jew on that day results in the concept of the Sabbath being observed at its highest potential.', 'חקת עולם, even at a time when there is no Temple, and hence no sacrificial service, the day of Atonement does not lose its function, and the Sabbath observance, i.e. abstention from work as well as the self-denial consisting of fasting for twenty four hours remains in effect.\n']"
Leviticus, 16,32,"['ואשר ימלא את ידו...ולבש, also a priest wearing the High Priest’s garments though not having been anointed with the holy anointing oil may be the instrument of the people’s atonement. [The conditions mentioned in our verse are not understood as cumulative and absolute requirements. (compare Rashi who explains that the holy anointing oil ran out already in the days of King Yoshiyahu during the first Temple, never to become available again. Nonetheless, even in the days of the second Temple, when the red cord turned white after the killing of the scape-goat, there was a sign from heaven that the people had been forgiven. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 16,34,"['והיתה זאת לכם לחקת עולם לכפר, that the very day itself has the power to confer atonement even when there is neither a Temple nor a Temple service. In the words of our sages (Yuma 86) “repentance suspends the imposition of retribution and the arrival of the date of the Day of Atonement completes the atonement.”']"
Leviticus, 17,2,"['זה הדבר, when the Torah said in 15,31 והזהרתם את בני ישראל מטומאתם, “you are to warn the Israelites regarding their state of ritual contamination,” the warning implied that they were to separate themselves from spiritually negative influences represented both by ritual contamination and by demons.']"
Leviticus, 17,4,"['דם יחשב, as if the relationship of man to the animals were as it had been before the deluge when it had been forbidden to kill animals as food.']"
Leviticus, 17,7,"['חקת עולם תהיה זאת, not to offer sacrifices to the demons even though they were not being equated with deities in any manner, but were considered only as creatures that could be employed by their human masters. They even used to employ such demons for errands to distant countries. We have documented proof of this in the case of Joseph Shida [the demon named Joseph].(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.59"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 59"">Sanhedrin 59</a>, compare Nachmanides) and about the demon who was prominent in the household of Rav bar Rav Ashi (Chulin 105). Had such demons been considered deities it is inconceivable that people of Rav Ashi’s stature or Rav Pappa’s stature would have had any track with them whatsoever.<br> It is reported in the Talmud that whereas little is known about the manner of these demons’ creation, they are known to eat and drink just as human beings. It is further worthy of mention that the sages, collectively, referred to the phenomenon of the demons as מזיקים, destructive, harmful phenomena. They multiply in a manner similar to humans and they die a regular death. They see without being seen themselves.<br> Apparently, although they are composed of composite material, their bones are extremely thin and transparent. The author speculates that just as ordinary human beings in common with the animals possess a נפש חיוני “intangible life-force” which, seeing that it dies with the body it inhabits, as distinct from the human נשמה which is an intangible spirit emanating in the celestial regions, is basically terrestrial in nature, these demons are “powered” by such a life-force. The reason we find that “life-force” referred to on occasion as נפש is the fact that it cannot exist without its tangible partner, the one which feeds on food and drink secured from what is available in our terrestrial universe.<br> Consider the very fact that the Torah describes “blood as the life-force” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.12.23"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 12:23"">Deuteronomy 12,23</a>). If someone were to sacrifice blood to such a creature, especially, seeing that it is powerful enough to sustain the life of such creatures, the blood sacrificed to such creatures would be equivalent to keeping these demons alive. (compare Maimonides, Moreh Nevuchim,3,46 on the subject).<br> This would be a violation of the statement in Chulin 105  כל מידי דצייר וחתים וכייל ומני לית לן רשותא למשקל מינעה. This is a conversation between the “owner” of a demon, Mar bar Rav Ashi, according to which the demon who had not paid back a loan on time to the “owner” claimed that his power to collect objects in this world did not include objects which were clearly defined and visible. From this Tossaphot <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Taanit.8"" data-ref=""Taanit 8"">Taanit 8</a> divrey hamatchil אלא בדבר concludes that if clearly defined and visible phenomena in this world were out of bounds to the demons unless they were definitely ownerless, phenomena which are not visible to us humans belonged to the category of phenomena over which such demons did have control.<br> At any rate, when a situation exists when many people find such demons useful and pliable to their wishes, people indulged in offering them blood so as to endear themselves to these creatures and to get them to perform their wishes. The people offering these gifts of blood used to eat it themselves also, in order to share more common ground with these creatures. Some people even made a point of consuming the blood of such “gifts” to the demons in the vicinity of the Temple. They were under the impression that these demons were performing their dances in that vicinity. They hoped to ingratiate themselves with these creatures by showing them this kind of “respect.”<br> When G’d decided to sanctify us and He separated His people from dependence on such demons and taught us not to pursue such ultimately useless phenomena and put our trust in them, seeing that contrary to a superficial perception they are really mazikim, destructive forces, as our sages correctly described them, He levied a severe penalty on people who continue such relationships as they used to entertain with demons. The penalty of karet means severance from one’s own people’s eternal future. (verse 10)<br> G’d levied a similar penalty on eating blood and offering gifts to these demons as He had levied at the time in Gan Eden when he forbade eating from the tree of knowledge on pain of man becoming mortal, i.e. losing an aspect of his infinity on this earth. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.2.17"" data-ref=""Genesis 2:17"">Genesis 2,17</a>). The Torah rationalized its prohibition and the severity of the penalty by stating: “for the soul (intangible life-force) of the flesh is in the blood.” This is the Torah’s way of referring to the almost invisible essence of these creatures. On the one hand, this essence is called nefesh “life-force,” on the other hand it is referred to as blood, as once the blood stops coursing through the veins of the body it feeds it is the end of the existence of both the body and life force of such creatures. G’d added (verse 11) ואני נתתיו לכם על המזבח לכפר, “I have given you an opportunity to present this blood on My altar in order to facilitate your atonement for your life-force.<br> The point G’d is making is that as opposed to these demons for whom such blood is an essential part of their nutrients, enabling them to stay alive, I, the Lord, do not need anything like this for Myself; on the contrary, I have provided you My people with an opportunity to remain alive yourselves by achieving atonement for your sins by means of sacrifices involving the life blood of the animal you are offering.<br> Sacrifices, offerings, in order to be meaningful as expiation, must be in a certain reciprocal relationship to the donor. If the donor had been guilty of forfeiting his life, only someone else’s life, in this instance the blood of the sacrificial animal, can possibly achieve this kind of atonement in lieu of the sinner’s lifeblood himself. Other parts of the sacrificial animal being burned up on the altar, similarly, correspond to the parts of the body of the donor which had been guilty of committing the sin for which the donor hopes to atone. (compare author on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.1.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 1:2"">Leviticus 1,2</a>)\n']"
Leviticus, 17,13,"['אשר יצוד ציד. Seeing that in the main, these free roaming beasts’ habitat is in desolate regions of the earth, areas in which the kind of demons we mentioned are at home, (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.13.21"" data-ref=""Isaiah 13:21"">Isaiah 13,21</a> “there ostriches shall make their home and there shall satyrs (demons) dance.”) the Torah therefore forbids to leave the blood of these beasts exposed and ordered us to cover it with earth in order to forestall any chance that this blood be used to feed the demons. It goes on to say:']"
Leviticus, 17,14,"['כי נפש כל בשר דמו בנפשו הוא, “for the life-force of all living creatures is its blood” [or contained with its blood. Ed.] (a reference to the way the author described such an almost invisible essence in the blood in his commentary on verse 7).', 'בנפשו, including this invisible life-force contained therein. This is because the blood contains something almost intangible. Seeing this ingredient is the closest to anything completely intangible in this terrestrial universe, it is an ideal nutrient for the demons and for those who consort with them. The Torah says:', 'ואומר לבני ישראל, although I have permitted the gentiles the consumption of such lifeblood, I have prohibited it to the Children of Israel already in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.26"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:26"">Leviticus 7,26</a> seeing that the life essence of living creatures is contained in it while the animal was alive and it is liable to transfer some of these animalistic characteristics kind to the persons ingesting it as food. The Torah wants to protect the Jewish people from absorbing more animalistic tendencies than we already possess.\n']"
Leviticus, 17,15,"['וכל נפש אשר תאכל נבלה וטרפה, after the Torah wrote about the prohibition of eating blood, something which if permitted would draw us closer to the circle of demons, it speaks about the prohibition of eating meat from diseased animals or animals which have died of causes other than ritual slaughter. A nation that concentrates on attracting the holy spirit to itself would do something counterproductive if consuming such carcasses which are the home base of spiritually negative influences. We know that this is so from the Torah’s prohibition of trying to derive spiritual inspiration from the dead or parts of them. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.18.11"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 18:11"">Deuteronomy 18,11</a> where consulting ghosts or other death-related matters is specifically outlawed, and we are ordered not to tolerate people who practice such cults in our land.)']"
Leviticus, 17,16,"['ונשא עונו. In accordance with the degree of spiritual contamination he has brought upon himself. There are different degrees of such spiritual contamination, of course, and the punishment will fit the seriousness of the transgression']"
Leviticus, 18,6,"['איש איש אל כל שאר בשרו לא תקרבו; logic would suppose that offspring from genetically related parents would result in superior human beings, evenly matched ones, as for instance in the case of Amram and Yocheved, where the marital union of aunt and nephew produced three outstanding human beings such as Miriam, Aaron, and Moses. In fact, the <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Yevamot.62a.63"" data-ref=""Yevamot 62a:63"">Talmud Yevamot 62,63</a> praises someone who marries his niece by quoting <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.58.9"" data-ref=""Isaiah 58:9"">Isaiah 58,9</a> who calls down a special blessing from heaven on such a person. [“Then when you call, the Lord will answer, when you cry, He will say: ‘Here I am.’”] <br> The considerations I have just mentioned are valid only if both parties to such a marital union are motivated exclusively  by the desire to carry out G’d’s will as they perceive it. However, truth to tell, this occurs in only rare cases. The vast majority of people, when choosing their mate, are driven by the desire to gratify their libido. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.7"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:7"">Psalms 51,7</a> הן בעוון חוללתי ובחטא יחמתני אמי, “Indeed, I was born with iniquity; with sin my mother conceived me.” <br>Seeing that genetically close relatives, usually living under the same roof, provide ample opportunity for the males and females of that family to engage in illegitimate sexual relations, and not only do they find it enjoyable but they do not consider it at all sinful, such pairings will hardly ever be for the purpose of marriage, but merely for the purpose of mutual physical indulgence. As a result, allowing marital relations of an incestuous nature would result in sexual promiscuity of major dimensions. This is why the Torah wrote לגלות ערוה, in most instances the very baring of flesh, and especially private parts, is the physical gratification desired in the first instance. This is why the Torah, in order to nip incest in the bud, addresses itself again and again to this phenomenon by using the expression לגלות ערוה, the titillation provided by feasting one’s eyes on the flesh of the opposite sex. When listing degrees of blood relationship, the Torah proceeds from the man’s vantage point, and in the case of the woman from the perspective of her husband. This is why in order of sequence the Torah first forbids the sister of one’s father who is a first degree blood relation to one’s father. On the other hand, the Torah permits the daughter of such father who is a relative of the second degree to the party. The Torah then prohibits the wife of one’s father and the wife of one’s brother and the wife of one’s uncle, even after their respective husbands have already died. This is in spite of the fact that no genetic connection exists between the people forbidden to one another as man and wife. The reason is simply that they Torah views them all from the perspective of how they are related to their husbands. This appears to be the guideline for all incest-related legislation.\n']"
Leviticus, 18,17,"['זימה היא, it is sexual union based only on lust and sinful intent.']"
Leviticus, 18,18,"['לא תקח לצרור, the Torah means that were it not for the competitive hostility which would result by the two sisters competing for the love of the same man, there would not have been a biological, genetic reason for forbidding such a union. Proof that this is the guiding motivation of the Torah is the fact that after the death of one sister, the surviving husband may marry the surviving sister.']"
Leviticus, 18,21,"['ומזרעך לא תתן להעביר למולך ולא תחלל את שם אלוקיך, the difference between offering sacrifices to the Moloch and to G’d respectively is that to G’d only animals are sacrificed, whereas to the deity known as Moloch, human beings, specifically one’s son, is sacrificed. This would indicate that the worshipper of the Moloch considers him as more powerful than G’d, for why else would he sacrifice his dearest possession, his son, to him and not to G’d?', '\'אני ה, I have never changed since the time I have sworn to Avraham “to be your G’d and for seed after you.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.17.7"" data-ref=""Genesis 17:7"">Genesis 17,7</a>). Seeing that G’d in this chapter had spoken about incest, matters related to human seed, and His interest in keeping this seed pure so that the holy spirit would be able to descend upon such people, He spoke about the Moloch  whose servants had intended to ensure that their other children would be blessed with every kind of success in recognition of their having given the oldest to their G’d. G’d is on record here that doing something like this, far from being a way to sanctifying G’d’s name would be the most potent way to desecrating His name. Such practices, far from attracting the benevolent presence of G’d, the Shechinah, would prevent this presence of G’d from taking up residence among the Jewish people..']"
Leviticus, 18,24,"['אל תטמאו בכל אלה, even by merely being physically close to such incestuous members of the opposite sex.', 'כי בכל אלה נטמאו הגוים, for the original depravity of the nations dwelling in Canaan before you involved precisely this ritual contamination. They did not start by actually sleeping with the partners outlawed to them, but by only fondling them.\n']"
Leviticus, 18,25,"['ותטמא הארץ, the next step was that the earth became contaminated by actual incestuous sexual relations between such partners.']"
Leviticus, 18,26,"['ושמרתם אתם את חקותי, not to reveal the nakedness, etc.', 'ואת משפטי, by punishing the guilty offenders.', 'ולא תעשו מכל התועבות, by observing these rules you will not become guilty of engaging yourselves in any of these abominable practices.\n']"
Leviticus, 18,27,"['כי את כל התועבות האל עשו אנשי הארץ, for these nations who did not observe these rules of incestuous sexual mores and who did not punish those who violated these rules, eventually committed all these abominations themselves, proceeding from a relatively minor sin to more serious sins; the same will happen to you if you will be lax in enforcing that these rules be observed, leaving it only to Me to punish the offenders. [it is interesting that the author predicts the outcome of allowing “consenting adults” to choose their own lifestyles. Ed.] This is why I implore you to observe this legislation in all its details.']"
Leviticus, 18,28,"['ולא תקיא הארץ...כאשר קאה את הגוי, and by abstaining from these abominations the land will not spit you out eventually (for other sins) in the same absolute manner in which the people presently in that land are being disgorged by it.']"
Leviticus, 18,29,"['כי כל אשר יעשה מכל התועבות האלה ונכרתו הנפשות, the reason why the land will spit you out if you violate even only part of these laws is that each one is a sufficiently serious violation in My eyes causing the deliberate perpetrator to be punished with the penalty of karet, total separation from the future of the people of the Jewish nation.']"
Leviticus, 18,30,"['ושמרתם את משמרתי לבלתי עשות מחקות התועבות, observe also the legislation which is in the nature of a protective fence against the major sin of indulging in actual sexual relations with the forbidden partners. Just as the legislation governing menstrual laws, eating of forbidden foods, sleeping with a woman ritually impure after giving birth, etc., have all been surrounded with what our sages call a סיג, “protective fence,” this legislation too has such a protective fence which must not be ignored except at your peril. The overriding consideration is לא תטמאו בהם, “do not become spiritually contaminated by ignoring these laws.”']"
Leviticus, 19,2,"['דבר אל כל עדת...קדושים תהיו; after the presence of G’d had manifested itself among the Jewish people, sanctifying them for eternal life, as had been the meaning of the verse in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.19.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 19:6"">Exodus 19,6</a> “you shall become for Me a nation of priests a holy nation,” and taking into consideration G’d’s statement in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.11.45"" data-ref=""Leviticus 11:45"">Leviticus 11,45</a> “I have led you out of the land of Egypt in order to be your G’d and your becoming holy,” G’d had in the meantime separated the Jewish people from impurity through the legislation concerning forbidden foods, skin eczemas, ritual impurity contracted through cohabitation with menstruant women, or women afflicted with excretions from their vaginas at times other than when they were experiencing menstruation.<br> G’d had also elaborated on other ritual contaminations contracted through sinful contact. The objective of all these parts of Torah legislation was to establish a nation that could be described as “holy,” not least of it the legislation concerning incest.<br> At this point, i.e. after achieving this “holiness,” i.e. emulating the Creator’s holiness in the maximum manner possible for creatures, the Torah spells out this objective by saying כי קדוש אני, “For I the Lord am holy;” the message is that the original intention in creating man in the image of G’d (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.26"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:26"">Genesis 1,26</a>) had already had as its declared goal for this “image” to become something constant. The Torah now proceeds to list laws which appeared on the first of the Two Tablets, whose objective it is to ensure enduring life for the Jewish people as we explained on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.11"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:11"">Exodus 20,11</a>.']"
Leviticus, 19,3,"['The Torah now begins to explain in detail the commandment to honour father and mother, by writing that everyone is to relate with reverence to his mother and father respectively. These words teach that in addition to providing for aged and economically unstable parents with food, drink and clothing, the children (adults by then) must not look down on their parents who in the meantime have become economically dependent on their children. Our sages spelled this out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.31"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 31"">Kidushin 31</a> where they said: “sometimes someone feeds his father the most delicious and expensive dishes while the manner in which he does this contributes to the son’s losing his share in the hereafter, whereas on the other hand, a son could earn his share in the hereafter even by expecting his father to perform physically hard labour.” In the latter case, the son explains to the father lovingly why he cannot offer him luxuries but he treats him with love and concern and listens to his father’s words of advice. Having dealt with the implications of the fifth of the Ten Commandments, the Torah now turns to the fourth of the Ten Commandments, that of Sabbath observance, and writes:', 'ואת שבתותי תשמורו, words which do not only refer to the Sabbath of Creation, but to a variety of “Sabbath” legislations such as the “Sabbath” of the land known as sh’mittah, as well as the Sabbath of “money,” i.e. the demand for the lender to forego repayment of past due debts by the debtor at the end of the sh’mittah year. Al these types of “Sabbath” legislation are testimony to the fact that the Creator Who legislates such laws was the originator of the universe, hence His right to demand such obeisances from His creatures.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,4,"['When the Torah now continues with the second of the Ten Commandments by warning us אל תפנו אל אלילים, the Torah elaborates that it is not only forbidden to make oneself such deities in order to worship them, etc., but that it is equally prohibited to display respect for such deities worshipped by other peoples as their gods. Nothing is to be done which would indicate that one invokes the supposed “power” of such deities to further one’s personal interest and concerns.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,5,"['וכי תזבחו, at this point the Torah explains that when G’d issued the very first of the Ten Commandments with the words: “I am the Lord your G’d, etc.,” (20,2) this meant that the Israelites must accept Him as the exclusive divine power in the universe. They are to do so without reservation, just as they did during the song of thanksgiving for their miraculous salvation after crossing the sea with dry feet, when they sang (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.15.2"" data-ref=""Exodus 15:2"">Exodus 15,2</a>) זה א-לי ואנוהו, אלוקי אבי וארוממנהו, “this is My G’d and I will enshrine Him, the G’d of my forefather and I will exalt Him.” Not only must the Jewish people accept G’d’s dictates and carry them out, but they must be concerned with preserving His great name and not even in their thoughts do anything which would desecrate this great name of His.']"
Leviticus, 19,9,"[""ובקצרכם...לעני ולגר תעזוב אותם, The Torah now turns to how we can emulate G’d’s attributes in [practice after having accepted that it is our purpose on earth to emulate G’d’s characteristics to the extent that He has revealed them to us. We are to perform acts of charity and righteousness. Part of such acts of charity are the providing for the underprivileged out of the bounty G’d has seen fit to grant us. The specific items known as leket, shikchah, and peyah are examples of such demonstrations of our generosity towards the poor. אני ה' אלוקיכם, this recognition of G’d as our G’d is demonstrated by our meticulously fulfilling these commandments relating to the time when we gather in our harvest. Before we even give tithes of the completed harvest which has been brought into the barn we already allow for the poor to help themselves to what other, gentile farmers, might consider the product of their own hard earned labour.""]"
Leviticus, 19,11,"['After this the Torah explains various aspects of civil law some of which are addressed to the people at large, whereas others are addressed to the judiciary and the manner in which they deal with the people. Others again are addressed to the heads of the nation. Still others emphasise that individuals must not infringe on others’ property, hence לא תגנובו לא תכחשו ולא תשקרו, all damages involving financial property. Also,\n']"
Leviticus, 19,12,"['לא תשבעו בשמי לשקר, revolves around felonious attempts to deny financial obligations one has entered into. וחללת את שם אלוקיך, by causing financial damage to your fellow man you would desecrate the holy name of the Lord your G’d.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,14,"['At this point the Torah warns that one must not cause distress to one’s fellow man by undermining his dignity, his self image and the image he enjoys among his peers. Example are: לא תקלל חרש, this is a damage that the deaf person does not even become aware of. Next, the Torah discusses tangible damages, such as ', 'לפני עור לא תתן מכשול, indirect damages, for who knows if the blind will trip over the obstacle? The one causing even indirect damage is held responsible by the Torah. [this is presumably in the realm of heavenly judgment, seeing that the Talmud feels that people, as opposed to animals, who have eyes in their head, should watch out for obstacles in their path. Ed.] ']"
Leviticus, 19,15,"['Now the Torah addresses the judges who are charged with dispensing fair judgment. לא תעשו עול במשפט, a warning not to relate sternly to one litigant while being lenient towards his opponent. Do not allow one litigant to sit down while his opponent is required to remain standing upright. This is followed by admonitions applicable to different levels of leadership in the people and the spirit of jealousy which often prevails between competing layers of the bureaucracy. Examples are: Doeg badmouthing David so as to gain favour with the king. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.22.9"" data-ref=""I Samuel 22:9"">Samuel I 22,9</a>) From such admonitions it is only a small step to warn against badmouthing people generally, especially when it even involves slander. The sin of slandering is considered so serious by the prophet Ezekiel that he describes it as being equal to bloodshed (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.22.9"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 22:9"">Ezekiel 22,9</a>)']"
Leviticus, 19,18,"['There follows a general, all inclusive rule to be observed in relations towards one’s fellow, phrased as ואהבת לרעך כמוך, telling us to apply the same yardstick to our concern for our fellow that we would want applied to ourselves if we were in his shoes in similar situations.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,19,"['One of the foremost ways in which to demonstrate our fear/reverence of the Lord is not by observing commandments which we find reasonable and useful, but by observing those commandments which we fail to understand, or worse, which run counter too what our intelligence dictates to our mind as being useful.  Hence the Torah urges: את חוקותי תשמורו, you must make a special point of meticulously observing G’d’s statutes. The motivation for doing so must not be merely fear of punishment, but blanket recognition that “Father knows best,” that the fact it was G’d Who legislated these statutes proves that they are intelligent and beneficial for us even if we fail to understand this. It is interesting that the Torah enumerates examples of such chukkim in areas which have nothing to do with “religion” as such, but with the most mundane of our activities. Examples are: the efforts to produce better strains of domesticated animals, better strains of agricultural products, etc. In each of these situations, even though scientific research may lead us to conclusions other than the ones indicated by the Torah, we must ignore such results of our own research. [I am updating the wording of the author to make them more relevant to our century. Ed.] Clearly, He Who created this universe would not legislate something that would endanger its existence. What applies in the field of agriculture, our economic base, applies equally in the sexual mores we are to observe [including such matters as “cloning” Ed.] as well as our foods, [maybe outlawing certain kinds of additives, in addition to such matters as mixing milk and meat. Ed.] Even in such apparently unrelated matters as trying to divine the future, the Torah is on record with a variety of statutes limiting our methods of enquiry. All of these laws, of course, come under the heading of chukkim, statutes.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,20,"['It is a fact that most of the statutes listed appear to forbid only things which appear opposed to what we are familiar with as “laws of nature.” The prominent exception to this is the legislation involving the שפחה הנחרפת לאיש. Surely, the fact that the male partner does not become subject to the penalty of 39 strokes whereas the female partner does, appears hard to understand and to reconcile with what logic dictates. Furthermore, the fact that the male partner in the sin is required to offer a guilt offering, איל אשם, although he committed the sin knowingly, seems completely at variance with what we know about the function of such offerings.<br> Nonetheless, the Torah herself provides a partial answer to this unusual legislation by writing כי לא חופשה, his sin is viewed as somewhat less serious seeing that she had not been legally capable of entering a binding marriage, the requisite financial token signifying her betrothal to the man being legally meaningless as she could not “own” anything, still being enslaved to one of her former masters. His principal sin consists of desecrating the institution of marriage, a Divine institution, hence a desecration of G’d’s name when ignored. Engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman who is still partially a slave is a form of practicing promiscuity. [my words. Ed.] The scenario described by the Torah denigrates in the first instance the dignity of the active partner, the male, not that of the passive partner the female. It is most likely, that she, the “passive” partner had seduced him and is therefore deserving of the penalty decreed for her by the Torah. The deliberate nature of the sin, as far as the male is concerned, is the fact that he knowingly demeaned himself. This makes it akin to an inadvertent sin, qualifying for the guilt offering decreed. \n']"
Leviticus, 19,26,"['לא תאכלו על הדם לא תנחשו ולא תעננו, all of these practices were commonplace also among the Israelites who were desperate to gain advance knowledge of what was in store for them individually. Such practices had to be eradicated if the people were to progress from an overall environment of spiritual morass, רוח טומאה, to spiritual bliss, רוח טהרה ונבואה, spiritual purity and prophetic spirit.']"
Leviticus, 19,27,"['Seeing that it is part of revering the Lord and honouring Him not to desecrate our own bodies which He sanctified to enable us to serve Him, the Torah begins with a list of prohibitions designed to emphasise this point. לא תקיפו, we must not desecrate our heads by removing its hair as is the custom of gentile clergy or fools and drunkards. Neither are we to shave off the beard which represents man’s dignity, הדרת פנים שלו, “Shabbat 152. Neither are we to make incisions on our skin, something that is customary amongst pagans as an expression of their grief for family members who have died. Excessive mourning of this kind could be interpreted as questioning G’d Who allowed the departed to die. The same applies to a well known method of tattooing one’s skin with indelible ink below the skin, a permanent defacing of one’s body, described as כתובת קעקע. The only “improvements” to our G’d given body we are to make is the sign of the covenant, i.e. the removal of the foreskin of our males. Allowing or encouraging one’s unmarried daughter to devote her life to one of harlotry is a major desecration of one’s purpose on earth. Not only does the daughter desecrate the name of G’d by doing so, but she also desecrates the image of her father and all that he stands for. The death penalty by burning is decreed for such conduct under certain conditions in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.21.9"" data-ref=""Leviticus 21:9"">Leviticus 21,9</a>.']"
Leviticus, 19,30,"['את שבתותי תשמורו, After the Torah warned concerning a number of practices that constitute a desecration, it now proceeds to legislate days and places and people who are sacred in varying degrees. This begins with את שבתותי תשמורו, to preserve the sanctity of the Sabbath days, a sanctity bestowed on the Sabbath by G’d Himself, and including all holy convocations, מקראי קדש, whose dates have been confirmed by the Sanhedrin, the Jewish Supreme Court.', 'ומקדשי תיראו, a warning to treat all holy sites with awe and reverence. This includes synagogues and all places dedicated to the service of the Lord, especially, the ones used for such activities by the public.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,31,"['Seeing that the seeking out of oracles such as the ov or yidoni for the gentiles is something akin to enquiring about their fate from G’d, and it involves instead of consulting the living G’d consulting the dead or their remains, the Torah prohibits this in the strongest terms saying אל תפנו אל האובות, meaning not only must you not turn toward them, but you must turn your back on them and on any other phenomena similar to them. The Torah does not need to add that no respect or deference must be shown to such phenomena.', 'אל תבקשו לטמאה בהם, do not search them out as they would confer spiritual contamination on you. However, the Talmud did permit us to study the manner in which these phenomena are being used when the objective is merely to understand the phenomenon, not to make use of it.

Leviticus, 19,32,"['מפני שיבה תקום, while it is in order to show respect and deference to someone whose experience in life is based on his age, this does not compare to the respect and deference that we must show to ', 'פני זקן, the elder who has achieved his rank in society due to his Torah knowledge, his constant striving to become more closely attached to G’d. (compare Kidushin 32.)\n']"
Leviticus, 19,33,"['After the Torah warned that the Torah scholars, etc., must be shown due respect, it also warns us not to treat with disdain people who are on the lower rung of the economic ladder. וכי יגור אתך גר לא תונו אותו, even if this unfair treatment consists only of words, not deeds. The Torah continues, ']"
Leviticus, 19,35,"['לא תעשו עול במשפט במדה במשקל ובמשורה, seeing that the term אונאה, unfair dealings, also includes unfair business practices, the Torah issues a general prohibition concerning this addressed both to the locally born Jew and the recent convert, or stranger. The words used include measures for measuring liquids, dry matters, as well as the use of deceptive weights.\n']"
Leviticus, 19,37,"['ושמרתם את כל חקותי ואת כל משפטי, study them so that you will become aware of how fair they are.', 'ועשיתם אותם, through your study of both My statutes and My social legislation you will become impressed with their worth so that you will observe them and carry them out as a result of having gained greater insight of their meaning.', ""'אני ה; the Torah means to remind us that observance of G’d’s laws must be because they are G’d’s laws, i.e. we must not add or detract from the details of these laws in the mistaken belief that we would improve them by our additions or subtractions. Seeing G’d Himself is surely perfect, how could His legislation be any less than perfect?""]"
Leviticus, 20,2,"[""אשר יתן מזרעו למולך, after the Torah had explained G’d’s plan to sanctify the Israelites in order for them to become as much like Him as is possible for any creature, and He taught them the path to take to achieve such an aim, it now warns of a lifestyle which could produce the opposite result.<br> The Torah now discusses the penalties that would befall three specific categories of people who defy the Torah and take a different path toward what they perceive to be their success in life on this planet. People guilty of these practices would contaminate their souls beyond redemption.<br> Category one are people who follow mistaken philosophies, a prime example being people who follow the cult of the Moloch. In verse 3 the Torah spelled out the spiritually negative consequences of following this cult with the words למען טמא את מקדשי, “this would counteract My declared purpose of sanctifying (you)”. <br> Category two, the relying on such oracles as ov and yidoni have already been described as spiritually contaminating in 19,31 with the words אל תבקשו לטמאה בהם, “do not attempt to become spiritually contaminated by them.” In 18,24-25 the Torah had already drawn attention to the fate which befalls the [previous inhabitants of the land of Canaan being due to their relying on such oracles.<br> The third category of spiritually counterproductive practices is the ingesting of the kind of food that the Torah outlawed in Leviticus chapter 11 and the negative results of violating these laws are repeated again in verse 25 of our chapter והבדלתם...ולא תשקצו את נפשותיכם  לטמא וגו',  “separate yourselves…do not become detestable…to spiritually contaminate yourselves.” <br>In Parshat Emor the Torah speaks of a different kind of spiritual (ritual) contamination which is caused mostly passively through contact directly or indirectly with dead human bodies. It also discusses physical blemishes, especially of priests, which disqualify such people from carrying out their duties in the holy precincts of the Temple. However, the legislation in that portion concentrates on the impediment such kind of ritual (spiritual) contamination represents when the afflicted party handles sacred matters, sacrificial flesh, etc., in any shape or form. Other aspects are the abuse of such sacred objects which as well as incestuous marriages, i.e. contaminating the pure semen a person has been born with by incestuous sexual relations with forbidden partners. <br> Here the Torah begins with the desecrating of one’s semen by sacrificing it to the abominable Moloch cult. The penalty to be applied to people guilty of this sin, which is perpetrated in public, is עם הארץ ירגמוהו באבן, the people at large are to stone the father to death. Only by the expression of jealousy on behalf of G’d can such a sin be wiped out, seeing it had a potentially spiritually negative effect on the entire nation. Naturally, the penalty by the hand of man is applied only if there was testimony by valid witnesses to the deed and the perpetrator had first been cautioned of the penalty to expect if he would go through with his intention.""]"
Leviticus, 20,3,"['ואני אתן את פני באיש ההוא, if he does not refrain from carrying out his evil intention and does not become a בעל תשובה, a repentant sinner. Otherwise, even his judicial execution will not expiate for his sin.', 'והכרתי אותו, seeing he has already been executed, these words refer to G’d excising this man’s soul’s share in the hereafter.', 'למען טמא את מקדשי, by removing My presence from Israel, resulting in the people deserving to be stoned. ולחלל את שם קדשי, therefore I will turn My face against him even though he did not actually engage in idolatry.\n']"
Leviticus, 20,5,"['ובמשפחתו, seeing that the people at large ignored his evil deed due to the sinner’s family covering up for him in the first place, thereby strengthening the hand of the perpetrator.']"
Leviticus, 20,7,"['והתקדשתם, by staying clear of all incestuous relationships.', 'והייתם קדושים, so that your seed will merit that the Divine Presence will dwell among the likes of him. Our sages are on record that “the Divine presence will rest only on those Jewish families that are genealogically pure.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.70"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 70"">Kidushin 70</a>)', 'כי אני ה\' אלוקיכם, the One Who said to Avraham “to be your G’d and that of your seed after you.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.17.7"" data-ref=""Genesis 17:7"">Genesis 17,7</a>) What was meant by the word לזרעך was the seed which is genealogically yours in an uncontaminated state. (as explained by <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bamidbar_Rabbah.12.4"" data-ref=""Bamidbar Rabbah 12:4"">Bamidbar Rabbah 12,4</a>)\n']"
Leviticus, 20,8,"['ושמרתם את חקותי ועשיתם אותם, the only way you can ensure that this degree of your sanctity continues throughout the generations is by ensuring your meticulous observance of the עריות legislation. If you were to fail to do this, your children, or some of them being born from a sinful, spiritually contaminated union, would already have these strikes against them from birth, making it so much harder for them to attain their G’d-set goal to achieve the level of sanctity expected of them. Compare David’s reference to the subject in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.51.7"" data-ref=""Psalms 51:7"">Psalms 51,7</a> where he considers the fact that one’s mother may have not have had the purest thoughts when cohabiting with her husband as already resulting in her child being born in sin, בעון חוללתי.', ""אני ה' מקדשכם, by forbidding you incestuous relationships I G’d have actively helped you in your attaining this sanctity, holiness.\n""]"
Leviticus, 20,9,"['כי איש איש אשר יקלל, proof that I, G’d, am so insistent that your sanctity be manifest by your seed being genealogically pure is that the penalty for non observance is the execution of the person who curses his parents. The normal scenario which leads to a son or daughter cursing their parents has to do with legitimacy or otherwise of their offspring. When a son or daughter are the product of unions forbidden under the laws of incest, children of such unions have little reason to practice the commandment to honour their parents as it was from their parents that they learned to ignore Torah legislation. Solomon’s well known instruction שמע בני מוסר אביך ואל תטוש תורת אמך, “heed the moral instruction of your father, and do not ignore the teachings of your mother” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.1.8"" data-ref=""Proverbs 1:8"">Proverbs 1,8</a>) are most difficult to honour when they know they have seen the light of day only because their parents chose to ignore this very instruction.']"
Leviticus, 20,25,"['ולא תשקצו את נפשותיכם בבהמה ובעוף ובכל אשר תרמוש האדמה, from all kinds of “impure” living creatures אשר הבדלתי לכם, from the ritually “pure.”', 'לטמא, in the sense that physically revolting creatures and especially ingesting them, will eventually contaminate the soul, the spiritual basis of the human being who has consumed them. This negative fallout is the result only of eating such creatures, not of carrying on trade involving them.\n']"
Leviticus, 20,27,"['ואיש או אשה כי יהיה בהם אוב או ידעוני, seeing that the thrust of all the preceding legislation had been to sanctify the Jewish people through their observance of these laws, anyone deviating from these commandments, turning instead to these oracles, is doing precisely the opposite of what the Torah wanted him to do. No wonder that his penalty is judicial execution by the harshest death penalty, i.e. being stoned to death.']"
Leviticus, 21,1,"[""ויאמר ה' אל משה אמור אל הכהנים, what has been written earlier so that they will understand and instruct each other in the various categories of ritual impurities and contaminations, including the difference between ritually pure domestic beasts and birds, for these are the aspects of foremost concern to the priests on a regular basis as we read in 10,10-11 ולהבדיל בין הקדש ובין החול, ובין הטמא ובין הטהור ולהורות, “and to separate the sacred from the profane, and  the ritually impure, and between the ritually contaminated, and to teach these values.” "", 'ואמרת אליהם, that the need to exercise caution in addition to these categories of the ritually pure and that which is not, also in regard to impurity conferred through contact with the dead as well as  through desecrating their seed.', 'לנפש לא יטמא בעמיו, no one of the priestly caste must ritually defile himself through dead bodies belonging to his nation., i. e. any dead person who is not one of the seven family members for whose sake he is to ritually contaminate himself to arrange for their burial, etc.\n']"
Leviticus, 21,4,"['לא יטמא בעל בעמיו להחלו, the reason why a priest is not to defile himself through contact with the dead except those of his next of kin, is that also the priest is indeed a בעל בעמיו, a distinguished, highly placed member of his people, it is his task to understand and teach these laws as we know from Maleachi 2,7 “for the lips of the priest are meant to guard knowledge, and Torah and the people will enquire concerning these from his mouth.” This makes him a person to be treated in the manner one treats a politically highly placed person, a king. Seeing he is supposed to be ever ready to serve the King of Kings, in His Temple, it is not appropriate for such a person to desecrate his status even temporarily in order to participate in the burial rites of ordinary people. According to our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.47"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 47"">Sanhedrin 47</a> the prime purpose of burying and eulogising the dead is to render honour to them. This conflicts with the honour the priests have to accord to G’d on an ongoing basis. However, the Torah exempts the priests from this restriction for burial and eulogising of near relatives from this rule. [some of the last line is my own wording, though it corresponds to the thoughts expressed by the author. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 21,5,"['לא יקרחו, even though I have permitted the priests  to defile themselves to bury their close relatives and express mourning rites, I have not permitted them to exaggerate such displays of mourning to include the making of bald spots on their heads and to make incisions in their flesh. As our sages phrased it, “just as the previous verses dealt with the dead, so the verses in front of us deal with honour for the dead.”(Torat Kohanim 1,3)']"
Leviticus, 21,6,"['ולא יחללו שם אלוקיהם, even though all of the aforementioned were expressions of grief over the loss of relatives, the priest is not permitted to disregard the dignity which his status as priest imposes upon him. Even though the priests, no doubt, mean to honour G’d in what they are doing, when they disregard the restrictions their status imposes upon them, they indirectly desecrate the name of the Lord.']"
Leviticus, 21,7,"['כי קדוש הוא לאלוקיו, every member of the tribe is by definition בעל בעמיו, an especially distinguished personage among his people. If he were to marry someone guilty of or unfortunate enough to belong to the categories mentioned in this verse, the husband would no longer be entitled to the sanctity his birthright had not only entitled him to but had expected him to preserve.']"
Leviticus, 21,12,"['ומן המקדש לא יצא. According to Rabbi Saadyah gaon, this means primarily joining the funeral cortege which requires leaving the holy precincts.', 'ולא יחלל את מקדש אלוקיו, so as not to desecrate the Temple of his G’d, as people would conclude that giving honour to the dead is more important than to remain within the sphere of G’d’s immediate presence, something he enjoys as the exceptional privilege of being exposed to on an ongoing basis.\n']"
Leviticus, 21,18,"['כי כל איש אשר בו מום לא יקרב, to stand and perform the Temple service. The principle is familiar to us from when Esther was aghast when her uncle Mordechai appeared wearing sackcloth in the courtyard of the Royal Palace (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Esther.4.2"" data-ref=""Esther 4:2"">Esther 4,2</a>).']"
Leviticus, 21,19,"['שבר רגל, an example of blemishes not caused by the priests’ bodies themselves.']"
Leviticus, 21,20,"['או גבן, (eyebrow) an example of blemishes caused by the body being deficient in some of its essential moisture. ']"
Leviticus, 22,2,"['וינזרו מקדשי בני ישראל, they should not think that the senior among them may treat the sacrifices donated by the people as if they were secular in nature as far as they were concerned. We are familiar with the principle alluded to here by the Torah from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Moed_Katan.16"" data-ref=""Moed Katan 16"">Moed Katan 16</a> מנודה לתלמיד אינו מנודה לרב, “if something is legally out of bounds to the student this does not automatically mean that it is equally out of bounds to the student’s teacher.” (although if the situation is reversed what is out of bounds to the teacher is most certainly also forbidden to the student. ולא יחללו את שם קדשי אשר הם מקדישים לי. They shall not desecrate the things the ordinary Jews have sanctified for Me, which now bear My holy name.\n']"
Leviticus, 22,7,"['כי לחמו הוא, and he need not await his atonement before he may eat what is his regular diet, לחמו. Our sages in Pessachim 35 stated that as soon as the sun has set the priest (who had ritually immersed himself after having contracted ritual impurity) may eat t‘rumah. [he may not yet eat sacrificial meats which are of a higher level of holiness until the following morning as those are not considered his לחמו, regular diet. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 22,9,"[""אני ה' מקדשם, I have sanctified them (the items sanctified as donations by the ordinary Israelites) It is therefore appropriate that priests who treat these sanctified objects with disdain (as if they were profane), be punished for desecrating them.""]"
Leviticus, 22,16,"[""והשיאו אותם עון אשמה, they themselves, when they declared the items in question (for instance t’rumah) as sacred cause themselves to become guilty in the event they would trespass and make profane use of them. The Torah does not allow you to apply the principle הפה שאסר הוא הפה שהתיר, that just as one may declare something forbidden, the same person can also declare it as allowed. (D’mai,6,11)  The reason why we cannot apply this principle in this case is אני ה' מקדשו, seeing that G’d Himself elevated this item to a status of holiness, a mere mortal, even the donor, cannot remove such sanctity at his own discretion.\n""]"
Leviticus, 22,18,"['אשר יקריב קרבנו, after the Torah had addressed the priests, who offer the sacrifices on the altar as well as their status of sanctity, it now discusses rules applying to the offerings themselves., saying that the following applies to לכל נדריהם ולכל נדבותם, even these offerings were voluntary offerings as opposed to mandatory offerings, and I might have thought that any such offering, even of a blemished animal, would be gratefully accepted by G’d, seeing the individual in question was under no obligation to offer any sacrifice at this time, the Torah states flatly that this is not so. The author, quoting Maleachi 1,5 as proof that one would not dare offer a gift to a human ruler that was less than perfect, how much less would one dare to do this “for” G’d, concludes that there must have been people in his time guilty of mistaking what is expected of them and offering inferior animals as sacrifices.\n']"
Leviticus, 22,19,"['לרצונכם , as a sacrifice that will confer G’d’s goodwill upon you, and not for the Temple treasury.', 'תמים זכר, it must be male and unblemished seeing the Creator is described as having produced work which is perfect, unblemished, when He created the universe. (Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.4"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:4"">Deuteronomy 32,4</a>)']"
Leviticus, 22,20,"['כל אשר בו מום לא תקריבו כי לא לרצון יהיה לכם, as elaborated on by Maleachi 1,8.\n']"
Leviticus, 22,21,"['After the Torah has warned that the burnt offering, עולה, is of such a high rank of such sacred items, קדשי קדשיםthat only unblemished male animals may be used for such offerings, and that this requirement pertains only to cattle and sheep or goats, i.e. conditions which are not applicable to bird offerings, (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.16"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 16"">Kidushin 16</a>) it continues with ואיש כי יקריב  \'זבח שלמים לה, to inform us that although this kind of meat offering is of a lower ranking sanctity, קדשים קלים and the Torah does not insist that such an animal must be male, in order to confer G’d’s goodwill on the donor, it must still be a perfect, unblemished animal of its species. We know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.3.1"" data-ref=""Leviticus 3:1"">Leviticus 3,1</a> that such offerings are acceptable also if a female animal is offered. Verse 22 explains that it is simply not acceptable to offer a blemished animal to G’d as a sacrifice. An additional rule why blemished animals are not acceptable are the words ואשה לא תתנו מהם על המזבח לה\'. The Torah informs us with these words that even if the blemish in the animal designated as the sacrifice originated only after it had been sanctified, the parts which are normally burnt on the altar, i.e. certain fat parts and membranes over the kidneys, because it simply is not acceptable that even if the parts designated for the altar are unblemished, anything which before getting to this stage had had a disqualifying blemish disqualifies the whole as it is looked upon with dismay by G’d.']"
Leviticus, 22,23,"['נדבה תעשה אותו, even though numerous blemishes may be apparent you may donate them for the Temple treasury although the donor thought that on account of these blemishes they would be rejected by the Temple treasurer. The Torah differentiates between gifts for the Temple treasury and animals destined for the altar. Whereas even minor blemishes disqualify an animal from being offered on the altar, no such restrictions apply to gifts known as נדבה. This is possible because the bodies of such animals do not possess any sanctity, such sanctity only applies to their value, i.e. to the money realised from the sale of such animals. This enables the body which was donated to be treated as if it had never been sanctified in any way.']"
Leviticus, 22,24,"['ומעוך וכתות, after the Torah spoke about the kind of physical blemishes which are of ritual consequence only in connection with sacrificial animals, and which must under no circumstances be caused to such an animal once it has been sanctified, the Torah turns to the kind of internal blemishes which one must not cause even to animals which have never been sanctified, are totally secular in their use.']"
Leviticus, 22,25,"['Even though gifts for the Temple treasury are accepted from pagans, no blemished animals are to be accepted from them as such. Even if the animal became blemished through a deliberate surgical procedure, such as castrating it, something which generally improves the value of the animal so castrated, it disqualifies it from use by the Temple treasury, not to mention as a sacrifice on the altar. Seeing that the gentiles consider such animals as superior, we could not apply to such gifts the criticism voiced by Maleach 1,8 which we referred to twice already. We might therefore have thought that seeing that in the donor’s eyes he presents a superior gift to G’d this would be acceptable; the Torah takes a dim view of castrating animals which were created to proliferate. The Torah describes such castrated animals as ', 'כי משחתם בהם מום, for their corruption is within them, (not only external). When disqualifying blemished animals for the altar the Torah did not only have in mind visible blemishes, which are after all, only external, but invisible blemishes also, the latter often being more serious.\n']"
Leviticus, 22,27,"['שור או כשב, after the Torah had mentioned the various defective animals that are disqualified from being offered on the altar, it now mentions a number of situations in which even a perfectly healthy specimen of the ritually qualified animals may also not yet (or no longer) be fit as a sacrifice on the altar. Just as we learned that the monetary value of the animal is not the only criterion regarding its acceptability for the altar, so we shall hear now that there are still other considerations which can disqualify an animal frrom its being welcome to G’d as an offering. <br> If an animal has not yet reached the eighth day of its life, it cannot be used as a sacrifice. If the owner of said animal, or the priest offering it on his behalf, intends to consume it or part of it outside the holy precincts allocated for such eating by the Torah, or said owner plans to eat it past the deadline set by the Torah for consumption of such sacrificial meat, the sacrifice not only becomes disqualified but the penalty is extremely harsh. The technical terms for such disqualify cations are מחוסר זמן, too young, or אותו ואת בנו, if the mother animal had been sacrifice already on the same day, or פיגול, if the donor or priest had planned to deviate from the halachah governing where and for how many days such an animal could be eaten after it had been slaughtered. The intention known as חוץ לזמנו, eating part of it beyond the deadline set by the Torah even carries the karet penalty. The time limits are spelled out in our verses here.\n']"
Leviticus, 22,29,"['לרצונכם תזבחו ביום ההוא יאכל, your intentions at the time of performing the sacrificial procedure must be to eat it on the same day, (compare Rashi), the reason for these rules bein אני ה\', seeing that I am perfect and My work is perfect, I will not tolerate deviations by you either by shortening the period or lengthening it. [seeing that this legislation has been dealt with in the Torah already in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.15-17"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:15-17"">Leviticus 7,15-17</a> may have prompted the author to refer to Rashi’s explanation on our verse that the beginning of the time frame is meant, i.e. the same day, one must not wait until the second day to start eating from it.. Ed.]\n']"
Leviticus, 22,32,"['ולא תחללו את שם קדשי, seeing that you the priests of all people are more aware than anyone of the perfection of My works, if you do not take care not to deviate from My commandments, this would be the greatest desecration of My holy name. The verse is reminiscent of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.36.20"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 36:20"">Ezekiel 36,20</a> where the prophet laments that the exiles who come to host countries behave in such a way that the leaders of the host countries exclaim in dismay that surely these cannot the people of whom they have heard that they emulate the ways of their G’d! ', 'ונקדשתי בתוך בני ישראל, to continue to perform miracles for them as I had vowed to do when I said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.10"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:10"">Exodus 34,10</a> “I shall display miracles in the presence of your whole nation as proof that אני ה\' מקדשכם, I, the Lord sanctify you.”\n']"
Leviticus, 22,33,"['המוציא אתכם מארץ מצרים להיות לכם לאלוקים. I wanted to become your immediate leader, not employing any intermediaries, just as I am an immediate leader for disembodied beings. Of course, this was based on the premise that you would walk in the path of My Holiness, as mentioned by <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.10.2"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 10:2"">Jeremiah 10,2</a> “do not learn the ways of the nations and do not be in awe of the portents you believe to see in the sky.”', '\'אני ה; I have not changed and I will continue to perform miracles as I have done in former times, unless you erect barriers between yourselves and Me by not  walking in the paths I have assigned for you.

Leviticus, 23,2,"['מועדי ה\' אשר תקראו אותם מקראי קודש, after the Torah had spoken on the subject of the animal offerings and the people offering them whose purpose it is to ensure that the Shechinah rests in/over the people of Israel. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.29.42"" data-ref=""Exodus 29:42"">Exodus 29,42</a> עולת תמיד לדורותיכם, פתח אהל מועד לפני ה\' אשר אועד לכם שמה; “a regular burnt offering throughout the generations, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before the Lord.” The Torah spoke of the festivals, days on which one abstains from the pursuit of secular matters. On some of these days one has to abstain from such activities completely, on others only partially. For instance, on the Sabbath as well as on the Day of Atonement there is a total cessation of everything which is called מלאכה, work, in the sense of a productive activity. These days are meant for us to occupy ourselves exclusively with Torah and other sacred tasks. To this effect the Torah wrote (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.9-10"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:9-10"">Exodus 20,9-10</a>) “you shall labour for six days and conduct all your activities, whereas the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your G’d.” On that day your activities should concern spiritual matters. On some of the days described as holy convocations there is a partial prohibition of work, desisting basically from the kind of activity related to the kind of labour involved in earning one’s livelihood. One is to enjoy these days. Concerning such days, our sages coined the phrase חציה לה\' וחציה לכם, “half for G’d and half for you.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Pesachim.68"" data-ref=""Pesachim 68"">Pessachim 68</a>) There is no doubt that when the Jewish people conduct themselves in this fashion that the Divine Presence will be at home among them. Assaph expressed this thought in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.82.1"" data-ref=""Psalms 82:1"">Psalms 82,1</a> which commences with the words אלוקים נצב בעדת א-ל וגו\', “G’d stands in the divine assembly. Among the divine beings He pronounces judgment.”  The meaning of the word מקראי קודש when applied to the days the Torah calls מועדי ה\' אשר תקראו אותם מקראי קודש is: “days of assembles of the people for sacred undertakings.” The word מקרא refers to an assembly, just as the words שבת and חודש are understood as meaning assemblies both in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.1.13"" data-ref=""Isaiah 1:13"">Isaiah 1,13</a> and <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.4.5"" data-ref=""Isaiah 4:5"">Isaiah 4,5</a> ', 'אלה הם מועדי, “these are the appointed dates on which I will demonstrate My pleasure in your company.” If you were to treat these dates as ordinary days, week days, they would turn from being מקראי קודש to מקראי חול assemblies devoted exclusively to the transient life on earth and the physical pleasures people want to experience in this life. They would then not be מועדי, “My appointed times,” but would turn into מועדיכם שנאה נפשי, “your appointed times, the ones My soul detests.” (same chapter in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.1.14"" data-ref=""Isaiah 1:14"">Isaiah 1,14</a>)\n']"
Leviticus, 23,3,"[""'שבת היא לה, He, the creator of light and darkness assigns these days in all your dwellings, wherever on earth. The reason this is spelled out is that we might have thought that just as days and nights are not constant, being longer in the summer than in the winter respectively, so that the hours of the first Sabbath in history might serve as the model for all future Sabbaths, and Jews over the world ought to observe the 24 hours which Jews in the land of Israel observe as their Sabbath. The Torah, by writing בכל מושבותיכם, indicates that the commencement and conclusion of the Sabbath depends on the local times of day and night, not on a central location. [as opposed to the determination of the monthly time when the new moon , i.e. the new month begins, which is related to its astronomical constellation in the sky over Jerusalem, which serves as the ”dateline” for the Jewish people.Ed.] ""]"
Leviticus, 23,5,"['\'בין הערבים פסח לה; although the day on which the Passover is being slaughtered is the 14th of Nissan, not one of the days listed as מקרא קודש, the Torah relates to it as if it were, seeing that this sacrifice, signifying the Exodus from Egypt, the redemption of the Jewish people from slavery, is at the root of the whole legislation governing the Jewish calendar. The sages are empowered to see to it that the annual calendar date which the Torah legislated for this sacrifice to be offered coincides with the month in which the spring equinox occurs, so as to ensure that we do not violate the concept of היום אתם יוצאים בחודש האביב, “on this day you left (Egypt) it was during the month of spring.” The concept of “spring” and its message of resurrection of nature which had hibernated during the winter is so strong that it is part of the אלה מועדי ה\' concept. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.16.1"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 16:1"">Deuteronomy 16,1</a>)']"
Leviticus, 23,8,"['והקרבתם אשה לה\' שבעת ימים, the offering of the mussaph offering for seven consecutive days is to remind us that the intervening days of this festival are not totally secular in nature, although only the first and seventh day have been accorded the title מקרא קודש. The whole matter of the mussaph, additional communal offerings, has not been gone into in detail here as this is a subject treated in Numbers when this legislation appears in detail in chapters 28-29. The reason why in connection with the New Year’s day the Torah does mention the offering of an אשה לה\', is that this day already qualified for a mussaph offering, it being not only the first day of the new year but also the first day of the month of Tishrey. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.29.6"" data-ref=""Numbers 29:6"">Numbers 29,6</a> the Torah once more draws our attention to this fact, [presumably to tell us that New Year’s day does not replace the significance of the date of the new moon. Ed.] If you were to counter that אשה ה\' is also mentioned in this chapter in connection with the day of Atonement, remember that what is referred to there are  burnt offerings and sin offerings, both on behalf of the High Priest and the people but not by each individual member of the people as are sin offerings generally, not mussaph offerings which are mandatory communal offerings. The reason why the Torah listed the Sabbath and the festival of matzot in a single paragraph is that both were legislated prior to the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Each of the other festivals has been accorded a paragraph of its own. The Torah commences its reference to the festival of weeks by speaking of the Omer, and the counting of the seven weeks from the Passover until that festival, seeing that the festival of weeks is also known as the harvest festival,חג הקציר and we thank the Lord for the שבועות חקות קציד, “who keeps for our benefit the weeks appointed for harvest” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.5.24"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 5:24"">Jeremiah 5,24</a>). The principal reason for the festivals is to afford us an opportunity to express our gratitude in prayer and in deed. For instance, an example is the appointed time for the festival during spring when we pray to G’d giving thanks for His having given us our freedom at the time of the Exodus from Egypt. The Omer was an expression of gratitude for the barley harvest, the earliest opportunity to fulfill part of the bikkurim legislation, presenting the first of the ripened crop to G’d. This prayer also contains a request concerning the future. The counting of the 49 days between Passover and the festival of weeks reminds us of the need to offer such prayers on a daily basis. On the festival of Sukkot, the festival of ingathering, we thank the Lord for having enabled us to bring the year’s major harvest under our roofs.']"
Leviticus, 23,14,"['בכל מושבותיכם, the prohibition to eat from the new barley harvest before the 16th of Nissan applies even when there is no Temple and no Omer offering can be brought to G’d.']"
Leviticus, 23,17,"['חמץ תאפינה, בכורים, the Omer was the first ripened barley; the offering mentioned in our verse here represented the first ripened stalks of the wheat harvest. This is why the festival of weeks is also known as יום הבכורים, “the day of the firstlings offering.” (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.28.26"" data-ref=""Numbers 28:26"">Numbers 28,26</a> where this מנחה חדשה, “new gift offering” is described). The more appropriate translation would be the “gift offering consisting of the new (grain) harvest.” <br>The reason that the Torah added the word לה\', “for the Lord,” [after all, all offerings are exclusively for the Lord, so why single out this one by name? Ed.] is that after first presenting this offering to G’d, the whole people may now enjoy the new wheat harvest. The verse from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.5.24"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 5:24"">Jeremiah 5,24</a> which we quoted earlier, referred to the סכנה, period of “danger” which this crop was exposed to while growing during which period so many things could have happened which would have ruined the eventual crop. Thanksgiving prayers are therefore called for, expressing our gratitude that nothing of what we worried about during those many weeks actually happened. [the word חקות in that verse may mean that the laws of nature according to which the crop would ripen was not upset by bad weather, and other climatic phenomena which would have ruined all of the farmer’s efforts during the season of ploughing and seeding. Ed.] The Torah, appropriately, legislated that in addition to the two loaves baked from the new wheat, which did not get on the altar, of course, also 2 sheep, etc., were offered as explained in connection with שלמי תודה, thanksgiving offerings in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.7.13"" data-ref=""Leviticus 7:13"">Leviticus 7,13</a>. \n']"
Leviticus, 23,21,"['חקת עולם לכל מושבותיכם, even though no manner of sacrificial offering could be offered in any of the countries to which Jews were eventually exiled, the “counting” part of this legislation would not be abandoned on account of this.']"
Leviticus, 23,22,"['ובקצרכם , after giving thanks for the harvest and its successful storing of it in the barns, the Torah warns of what has to be done to ensure that the financial success which this harvest represents not be ruined. This is why the farmer is commanded to set aside, or simply not harvest, such incidentals as are referred to as לקט, שכחה, פאה, which in the words of our sages in Ketuvot 66 are viewed as מלח ממון חסר, ואמרי לה חסד. “money cannot be salted away (for safekeeping.)” Some people, in a play on words, change the word חסר for חסד, loving kindness, a kind of charity,” suggesting that the only way to ensure that one does not lose one’s own money is by engaging liberally in handing out charity to the deserving. The legislation in our verse then is this insurance for the farmer not to lose his crop even after he has already brought it into the barn.', ""אני ה' אלוקיכם, the many faceted functions of G’d are alluded to here, i.e. that G’d’s supervision is needed at all stages of the growing of the crop,; He is the G’d of the reapers, the G’d of the collectors. G’d says that “My regulations are designed to be beneficial for you the grower, for the poor who collects the gleanings. I will deal beneficially with those who have already demonstrated their concern for others by complying with the legislation set forth here.”\n""]"
Leviticus, 23,24,"['זכרון תרועה, a remembrance of the Royal t’ruah. When jubilating toward one’s king, one employs these blasts on the trumpets or shofars to demonstrate such regard for one’s king. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.81.2"" data-ref=""Psalms 81:2"">Psalms 81,2</a> הרניני לאלוקים עוזנו, הרנינו!, “stir up jubilation to G’d, our strength, raise a shout!” The expression זכרון, is an allusion to the fact that on this date G’d sits on the throne of Justice remembering the deeds of each one of His subjects and evaluating them as a judge. This is why the Talmud in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Rosh_Hashanah.8"" data-ref=""Rosh Hashanah 8"">Rosh Hashanah 8</a> calls on us to recite verse 4 in the above mentioned chapter of Psalms which reads תקעו בחודש שפר בכסא ליום חגנו, כי חוק לישראל הוא משפט לאלוקי יעקב, “blow the horn on the new moon on the day the moon is veiled, on our feast day, for it is a statute for Israel a ruling of the G’d of Yaakov.” On such days we have additional reason to rejoice in the fact that He is our King, who inclines toward leniency, and is likely to find us as possessing sufficient merit to pass this examination of the way we led our lives in the year just concluded. Isaiah  expresses these sentiments in referring to G’d as כי ה\' שופטנו, ה\' מחוקקנו, ה\' מלכנו, “for the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.33.22"" data-ref=""Isaiah 33:22"">Isaiah 33,22</a>)']"
Leviticus, 23,27,"['אך בעשור לחודש השביעי, even though on all the other days described in this chapter as מקראי קודש it is proper to express our joy on these days by means of food and drink, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Nehemiah.8.10"" data-ref=""Nehemiah 8:10"">Nechemyah 8,10</a> where Ezra asks the people on New Year’s day אכלו משמנים ושתו ממתקים, “eat choice foods and drink sweet drinks,” the tenth of this month the day known as Yom Hakippurim, Day of Atonement, is a day devoted to confession of our sins and a day when a person comes to grips with the sins he has been guilty of. On this day it is not in order to  preoccupy oneself with anything other than the quest to obtain G’d’s forgiveness and to achieve expiation of one’s sins. Instead of eating and drinking, the order of the day has been best expressed by <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.58.3"" data-ref=""Isaiah 58:3"">Isaiah 58,3</a> הן ביום צומכם תמצאו חפץ וכל עצביכם תנגושו, “because on your fast day you see to your business and you oppress your labourers!” [the prophet sarcastically chastises the people who, while technically fasting, expect G’d to listen to their requests while they continue in their wicked ways, going only through the motions in their religious observance. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 23,28,"['seeing that most of the people guilty of not practicing self denial do not do so to annoy G’d, but because they cannot resist the allure of the  gratification beckoning to them, whereas most of the people violating the commandment not to work on the day do so because they want to indicate their independence of G’d’s dictates, the penalty of karet is in store for eating or drinking on the day of Atonement, whereas destruction of one’s soul is in store for people deliberately violating the work prohibition applicable on this day.']"
Leviticus, 23,31,"['בכל מושבותיכם, even though nowadays there is no way of obtaining atonement by means of the altar which is part of commandments applicable to this day.']"
Leviticus, 23,36,"['עצרת היא. The concept of עצירה is something apart from the concept of שביתות. The latter pertains to abstaining from ordinary secular activities, whereas the former entails spending a certain amount of time performing holy tasks, studying Torah, engaging in communal prayer, etc. The expression נעצר occurs in this context in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.21.8"" data-ref=""I Samuel 21:8"">Samuel I 21,8</a> ושם איש מעבדי שאול ביום ההוא נעצר לפני ה\', “and there was a man, one of Saul’s officials detained before the Lord, etc.”  In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joel.1.14"" data-ref=""Joel 1:14"">Yoel 1,14</a> we find the line קדשו יום, עצרו עצרה, “solemnize a fast, proclaim an assembly!” In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.10.20"" data-ref=""II Kings 10:20"">Kings II 10,20</a> we find that Yehu proclaimed an assembly in honour of the Baal, [he meant to make sure that he could kill all those who would worship the Baal, which he succeeded in doing, eradicating this cult from Israel. Ed.] The invitation read: קדשו עצרה לבעל, “proclaim a holy assembly for the Baal.” It is in this sense that the Torah refers to the day following the seventh day of the Sukkot festival as Atzeret, an assembly for G’d, the pilgrims for the Sukkot festival to Jerusalem being detained there for an additional day. The joy on that day was to be a Torah inspired and oriented joy, akin to when David says in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.149.2"" data-ref=""Psalms 149:2"">Psalms 149,2</a> ישמח ישראל בעושיו, “Israel rejoices in its Maker.”<br>We find that the description of the family dinners held in the home of Job’s children, his seven sons and three daughters, at set intervals such festive get togethers were held. On the day after the completion of these festivities their father would send word to them to sanctify themselves and rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings to atone for the possibility that they might have been remiss and committed some misdemeanour which would have displeased their G’d. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.1.4-5"" data-ref=""Job 1:4-5"">Job 1,4-5</a>)<br> On the seventh day after the Exodus from Egypt the Israelites took time out to sing a song of thanksgiving to G’d for their final delivery from the pursuing Egyptians. Subsequently, in commemoration of that occasion, the Torah decreed that this day become an עצרת, a day devoted to contemplation of the great miracle on that first occasion. (Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.15.1"" data-ref=""Exodus 15:1"">Exodus 15,1</a> and <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.16.8"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 16:8"">Deuteronomy 16,8</a>).<br> Again, on the fiftieth day after the Exodus when the Israelites in a great assembly at Mount Sinai spent the day contemplating their elevation to an almost supernatural people, this day was also subsequently observed as an עצרת, although in the Torah this day is never referred to as such. The reason why the Torah itself does not refer to this day as an עצרת may be the fact that shortly thereafter all the accomplishments of this day were lost and the Jewish people were even commanded to divest themselves of the “jewelry” they had worn in commemoration of that wonderful day. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:6"">Exodus 33,6</a>)\n']"
Leviticus, 23,39,"[""אך בחמשה עשר יום, after the Torah had discussed the subject of the festivals in general terms, i.e. their common denominator being that these days are called מקראי קודש on which fire offerings on the altar are being offered on the altar in the presence of the Lord, the Torah continues 'אך בחמשה עשר יום וגו, by showing that the festival of Sukkot is different from all the other festivals: 1) the eighth day of that festival is called as we know from וביום השמיני שבתון, that the eighth day of that sequence of days is to be regarded as a kind of Sabbath. Such a concept does not exist as a special, day in the “week,” nor on the festival of matzot, neither in connection with months or years. In respect of all of these only the number seven has a connotation of holiness, not the number eight.<br> 2) This is the only festival in which the Jew is required to change his home, move out of his regular home, as stated clearly in verse 42. <br>3) it requires that every Jew take four plants of specific categories and wave them in the 6 directions on earth. (compare verse 40)""]"
Leviticus, 23,43,"[""אני ה' אלוקיכם, the meaning of the statement, repeated again and again, is that the reason that G’d requests these symbolic deeds from us is that by performing them we insure that He will not ever turn His benevolent eyes away from us.""]"
Leviticus, 24,2,"[""'צו את בני ישראל ויקחו אליך שמן וגו, after the oil which had been donated before the Tabernacle had been built and erected, G’d commanded that the Israelites for all future generations should provide this oil as their contribution.""]"
Leviticus, 24,3,"['יערוך אותו אהרן, even though the procedure of lighting the Menorah, as well as the presentation of the daily incense offering was permitted to be carried out by any priest of the roster during future generations as per the sages’ tradition (Sifrey Behaalotcha 60), this procedure is linked to Aaron, seeing that all the time the Jews were in the desert the procedures involving the Temple service were on a “Day of Atonement” footing because the Torah linked the procedure to the line (17,2) “for I will manifest Myself above the kapporet by day and the column of fire will be visible at night,” a condition which ceased when the Jewish people settled in the land of Israel. It followed that procedures which took place inside the sanctuary would be the exclusive prerogative of the High Priest during those years. These procedures would be performed in the future by the High Priest  on the day of Atonement.']"
Leviticus, 24,5,"['ולקחת סולת, this commandment presumably also applied only after the initial donation of such flour which had been contributed when the Tabernacle was being built had been exhausted. That original amount had been included in what was mentioned in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.39.33"" data-ref=""Exodus 39:33"">Exodus 39.33</a>. [one wonders where all the flour came from during those years when the Jews, in the desert were cut off from contact with the surrounding nations so that even their exact location was unknown. Ed.] ']"
Leviticus, 24,10,"['והוא בן איש מצרי, this is why he had the effrontery to curse the tetragram; none of the Israelites would have been so deficient in reverence.']"
Leviticus, 24,15,"['כי יקלל אלוקיו, and thereby transgresses the negative commandment אלוקים לא תקלל, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.22.27"" data-ref=""Exodus 22:27"">Exodus 22,27</a>)', 'ונשא עונו, he will have to carry the burden of his punishment. In other words, this is a problem between him and his Maker, no human court being involved, seeing the sin was committed in private and he had not cursed G’d’s essence but one or more of His attributes. This “leaving him to G’d,” is also applicable when the blasphemer “only” cursed one of the attributes G’d is known by.\n']"
Leviticus, 24,16,"[""ונוקב שם ה' מות יומת, the penalty of someone cursing the tetragram is not comparable to the punishment for someone who “merely” cursed one of G’d’s attributes. The individual described in our verse will be executed publicly by stoning, and all who heard him commit this crime must participate actively in the execution."", 'כגר כאזרח, and the type of the penalty applied to the blasphemer in our paragraph was not especially harsh seeing the guilty person had been a convert. Natural born Jew and converts are treated exactly alike in the legislation concerning blasphemy.\n']"
Leviticus, 24,17,"['ואיש כי יכה כל נפש אדם, seeing that among some nations cursing the deity is considered a very minor sin as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.8.21"" data-ref=""Isaiah 8:21"">Isaiah 8,21</a> והתקצף וקלל במלכו ובאלוהיו, “and he shall rage against his king and his divinity, etc.;” we know from our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.60"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 60"">Sanhedrin 60</a> that when one hears a gentile blaspheme (even against our G’d) one need not rend one’s garment in mourning over having been a witness to such blasphemy, for if that were not the halachah our garments would consist of innumerable shreds.<br>Keeping this in mind, we might have assumed that the curse uttered by the blasphemer in our paragraph should have been treated as irrelevant. This is especially so since we are all aware that blaspheming against G’d does not harm Him in any way, is an exercise of man’s frustration, not something harmful to the object of his blasphemy. The Torah explains that the reason why this blasphemy is treated as if something of substance, G’d forbid, must be seen in a different context. We know from Torah legislation that each deliberate act of disobedience against G’d is basically an act of insurrection, mutiny, and we could expect it to be treated as such, i.e. as equivalent to forfeiting one’s life.<br>Nonetheless, the Torah has demonstrated that some deliberate sins rate quite different punishments than others. Basically, the Torah provides for financial penalties, physical punishment, and the death penalty. Clearly, this proves that G’d views different sins as differing in degree of insurrection, or due to different degrees of provocation experienced by the sinner. Killing a human being, basically deserves the death penalty, i.e. anything less would mean that the killer’s life is worth more than that of his victim. When someone kills an animal, this is not comparable, so that the penalty is financial, restitution to the owner for what he lost.<br> When someone causes injury (deliberately), if the injury was caused to a fellow human being, by rights, the offender should be punished by bodily punishment, unless he were physically too weak to endure such punishment. Seeing that it is impossible to impose an exact equivalent for the injury caused, the sages decided to substitute a financial penalty instead. We must not think that the offender thereby gets off lightly, as the financial compensation comprises five different categories of harm suffered by the injured party, including even his injured pride. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Bava_Kamma.83"" data-ref=""Bava Kamma 83"">Baba Kamma 83</a>)<br>When someone injures an animal the financial penalty is considerably milder. When someone causes injury to a human being we also distinguish between one human being and another. If he injured his father or mother, he is guilty of the death penalty, whereas an injury of similar severity to someone else draws only a financial penalty; when he injures an animal it is obvious that the penalty would only be financial. Cursing father or mother is not mentioned in the Torah here as it is in a different category altogether, seeing that this cannot be compared to blaspheming, words which by themselves have no effect, since what can man possibly do to harm G’d?. Parents may be harmed by their children’s curses though not necessarily visibly. [some of the wording is my own. Ed.]']"
Leviticus, 24,22,"['כגר כאזרח יהיה, for I the Lord your G’d am just as much the G’d of the convert (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.34.19"" data-ref=""Job 34:19"">Job 34,19</a>).']"
Leviticus, 24,23,"[""ובני ישראל עשו כאשר צוה ה' את משה, they did not stone him as an act of revenge, or because they hated the individual being stoned; they did it merely in order to fulfill G’d’s commandment.""]"
Leviticus, 25,1,"['וידבר ה\' אל משה בהר סיני, it is noteworthy that nowhere else when the Torah announces new legislation does it also mention where this legislation was originally issued. The only time such locations are mentioned is when a new element of that commandment is added. We have heard about the principle of the sh’mittah legislation in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.11"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:11"">Exodus 23,11</a> where the general outline was presented, the Torah writing that the produce of the land during the seventh year should be left untouched by the farmer and is intended for the poor of the nation.<br>Now the Torah reverts to present this legislation in greater detail. This is the reason why we are told where these details were first spelled out. What we read here is only a prototype. The principle does not apply only to the sh’mittah legislation, but wherever some legislation had been mentioned in a general manner only, when the details were filled in this took place at Mount Sinai, just as it did in the case of the sh’mittah legislation. (Torat Kohanim 1,1)<br>The reason that Moses mentioned this particular legislation at this point is because at this time he was still under the impression that the Israelites would proceed in short order to the land of Canaan, the sin of the spies which set them back by forty years not having occurred yet. Even as late as <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.10.29"" data-ref=""Numbers 10:29"">Numbers 10,29</a> Moses still spoke to the people of the impending journey to the Holy Land. Speaking about the soil of the holy Land “resting,” is the subject in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.26.34"" data-ref=""Leviticus 26:34"">Leviticus 26,34</a> as well as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Chronicles.36.21"" data-ref=""II Chronicles 36:21"">Chronicles II 36,21</a>.

Leviticus, 25,2,"['כי תבואו אל הארץ, a reference to the land west of the river Jordan (Torat Kohanim 2)', 'ושבתה הארץ, .a reference to the soil intended for farming.', '\'שבת לה, so that during this whole year the farmer instead of “serving” the soil which requires cultivation, will turn his efforts to serving G’d directly instead. Just as the weekly Sabbath is a day set aside for intensive service of the Lord, so the sh’mittah year is to serve the same purpose. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.20.9"" data-ref=""Exodus 20:9"">Exodus 20,9</a>)']"
Leviticus, 25,3,"['שש שנים תזרע שדך, the new revelation in this verse is that the land of Israel is so fertile that the same piece of land can remain under cultivation for six consecutive years, although in other countries the land generally is allowed to lie fallow every other year.

Leviticus, 25,11,"['יובל היא שנת החמישים שנה תהיה לכם, just as the soil will become free from those who have purchased it, it will not be enslaved to the owners that are returning to it; during that year they must not yet use it as if it were their own.']"
Leviticus, 25,12,"['קדש תהיה לכם מן השדה תאכלו, even though I forbade the owners to use this land for sowing and harvesting, and not to gather the fruit of the field as in other years, as in verse 11 where all manner of harvesting is enjoined, I did not forbid the owners to eat of its produce. They are not at a disadvantage compared to the general population who do not have a claim on their fields. The legislation parallels that of the sh’mittah legislation.']"
Leviticus, 25,13,"['תשובו איש אל אחוזתו; it is permitted for the owners to take possession of it as their ancestral heritage, and to use it to build houses thereon, construct pens for the flocks, etc., as proof that it is again theirs.']"
Leviticus, 25,14,"['וכי תמכרו, in any sale it is forbidden to disadvantage the seller or the purchaser. For instance, the seller must not skim off any dust particles from the top of the drawer to create the impression that the purchaser receives completely refined merchandise none of which turns out to be substandard or useless. (Baba Metzia 60)', 'או קנה, when the purchaser is unaware of the true worth of the merchandise, even if by then it had already come into his possession and he had an opportunity to show it to a friend who is more knowledgeable.', 'אל תונו, even though the sages said that there is no overcharging when land is involved. (Baba Metzia 56), this applies to the price charged for the land itself. When it comes to calculating the remaining number of years before the next Jubilee year one must not mislead the purchaser [such as saying that there are 18 years left before the next Jubilee year, withholding the information that for at least 2 of those years the land may not be worked so that the purchaser should pay only for 16 anticipated harvests instead of 18. Ed.]\n']"
Leviticus, 25,15,"['במספר שנים תקנה, you are to pay a price corresponding to the number of years that you will own the land. Our sages state that when it comes to matters which are subject to verification by weight, by measure, or number, even if the overcharge amounted to less than 1/6th, the usual leeway when buying things in “bundles,” etc, is refundable. (Baba Metzia 56)', 'אחר היובל תקנה, there is no point in purchasing a field during the actual Jubilee year, as a situation might arise in which the returning owners cannot retain possession of it for any meaningful amount of time at all, depriving them of the feeling that they had benefited from the Yovel institution. ', 'שני תבואות, years during which a harvest is produced, not years of drought, etc. The conditions are parallel to a farmer who enters into a tenancy agreement working the field for the owner and giving him a portion of the harvest.\n']"
Leviticus, 25,16,"['תרבה מקנתו, you will buy it at a higher price than would have been the case if you had only rented it. The reason why the seller is entitled to a proportionately better price is that over a period of years any investment the owner makes in building on such property will be worth his while, and will be amortized over many years, whereas a rental agreement does not permit the renter to make such changes.', 'תמעיט מקנתו, that you do not have to pay a price as if you had only rented it. Naturally, if the sale is for a few years only, such considerations are taken into account. כי מספר תבואות הוא מוכר לך, for when you buy the land for a few years only, the only use you can make of it is the harvests which it will yield. Shortness of tenure does not permit the owner to invest in superstructure on the field and to amortize his investment. The purchaser also cannot grow the kind of crop which weakens the soil such as flax, as by the time he has to return the field to the original owner it must be returned in a condition similar to the one when he had bought it. Baba Metzia 109 states specifically that if someone purchased a piece of land for a few years only, he is not permitted to grow flax on it.']"
Leviticus, 25,17,"['ולא תונו, the reason this is repeated so many times is to warn you that you must not even misrepresent by words and thereby treat your customer unfairly. Even if the damage caused is not measurable in terms of money, all manner of misrepresentation is forbidden.', ""כי אני ה' אלוקיכם, I, G’d am both buyer and seller. This is why I am meticulous and adamant that neither practice be tolerated.\n""]"
Leviticus, 25,18,"['ועשיתם את חקותי, the sh’mittah and Yovel legislation. ואת משפטי תשמרו, the social laws governing the sale and purchase of property in relation to the Yovel so that no cheating of any kind takes place.', '.וישבתם על הארץ לבטח.

Leviticus, 25,19,"['ואכלתם לשובע, the produce of the land will prove nutritious. An example of this is the manna when the same quantity, an omer per head, whether for a baby or a fully grown person proved adequate, showing that G’d had imbued it with the nutrients needed by the person eating it. [It was the most individualised diet ever. Ed.] Our sages describe this as an example of food adjusting to the body’s needs after it had come into a person’s entrails. (Torat Kohanim, Bechukotai 1,7) This is also how we can understand that the crops grown in the sixth year of the sh’mittah cycle were able to be sufficient for the people’s needs during the seventh year.', 'וישבתם לבטח עליה, you will not need to be embarrassed by having to import food because your land did not provide you with sufficient means of nutrition.\n']"
Leviticus, 25,20,"['וכי תאמרו מה נאכל, when you raise doubts about this promise which I have made you, asking that you would not have enough to eat because you cannot believe that the quality of such food would compensate for its lack of quantity.']"

Leviticus, 25,40,['כשכיר כתושב יהיה עמך. A Jewish servant whose labour has been acquired and paid for 6 years in advance by the person hiring him shall be treated as if he had been hired by the year.

Leviticus, 25,42,"['כי עבדי הם, even though this labourer had “sold” himself to you, thus meaning to acquire a new master, it might have been assumed that you might treat him like a servant instead of like a hired labourer, the fact remains that seeing he was and remains “MY” servant; this is not the way you can treat him. No Jew is legally able to sell his body, seeing that he already “belongs” to G’d.']"
Leviticus, 25,48,"['אחרי נמכר גאולה תהיה לו; our sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.20"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 20"">Kidushin 20</a>) have already explained that you are not to say that seeing that this Jew has sold himself and has even become a priest to a pagan cult “I will kick away this stone which has already fallen,“ i.e. not make an effort to buy his freedom. This is why the Torah had to write: “even after he has sold himself in a most undignified manner, he is entitled to be redeemed.”']"
Leviticus, 25,50,"['וחשב עם קונהו, even though the pagan who purchased him is legally under your authority so that you could force him to release this Jew for less than he was worth, and moreover the sale was not legal in terms of our halachah, you must compensate him fairly.']"
Leviticus, 25,51,"['אם עוד רבות בשנים, there is no doubt that once the Jew has been in the service of his pagan master his services have become more and more valuable due to his knowing exactly what is expected of him, the compensation due to his master is based on a division of the purchase price into equal parts for every year he has not served out in his contract. The matter is described in detail in Kidushin 20']"
Leviticus, 25,52,"['ואם מעט נשאר, so that the years of “good” labour  rendered have already given the employer value for the money he had originally paid, allowance is made for the number of actual years which were not completed in the original contract. This is what our sages call: נתמעט כספו, כפי שניו, (Kidushin 20)']"
Leviticus, 26,1,"['לא תעשו לכם, even though you yourselves are now subservient to the pagans, as for instance the Jew who was forced to sell himself to a pagan, you must not trade your dignity, i.e. your religion, for a religion which is totally useless. Although this whole line appears superfluous, as the Torah had spoken on this subject repeatedly, the Torah here inserts this line so that people who due to force of circumstances had to enter the service of pagans, and who attribute this to their own G’d having abandoned them, do not commit the additional error of thinking that Judaism no longer has a claim on them in such circumstances. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.20"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 20"">Ezekiel chapter 20</a> the prophet dealt with the people who wanted to know how G’d could still have a claim on them seeing he had “sold” them to the pagans into exile. The matter was compared to a husband who had divorced his wife and continued to dictate to her. One of the most convincing answers is that G’d continues to speak of “My servant David” in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.3.18"" data-ref=""II Samuel 3:18"">Samuel II 3,18</a>, the same description G’d applies to Nevuchadnezzar in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.28.9"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 28:9"">Jeremiah 28,9</a>. In other words, no human being whether out of his own volition or because he considers himself rejected by G’d, is ever free from the obligation to serve the Creator, His ultimate Master.

Leviticus, 26,2,"['את שבתותי תשמורו, even during the period when you find yourselves in exile, even though that any rest observed during such periods is a reminder of your erstwhile freedom instead of your slavery in Egypt, and the fact that even G’d rested on the seventh day.

Leviticus, 26,3,"['אם בחקותי תלכו, chukkot are like Royal decrees, something person has to be guided by if he expects his endeavours in life to prosper.

It means that they cannot just be performed by rote but must be performed consciously as such. This has been spelled out by Sifri, Parshat Re-ay where the wording is: “שמור =study.” The thrust of our verse then is as follows: “if you will conduct yourselves in accordance with the practical part of My Torah, i.e. the performance of commandments requiring deeds, and you will study these laws in order to understand their purpose and in order to give meaning to your performance of these laws, you will accomplish that you will deserve the description of being a creature which reflects “His image.”', 'ועשיתם אותם, if you will carry them out in the above-mentioned manner, not as servants who are afraid of incurring the wrath of their masters, this will be the “finishing touch” of your establishing a total claim to the land of your inheritance.

Leviticus, 26,11,"['ונתתי משכני בתוככם, “My Shechinah will reside amongst you, everywhere;” The meaning is that the close relationship which had existed between the Jewish people and its G’d before the sin of the golden calf would be restored.

[If I understand the author correctly, this whole passage is not to be interpreted as chronologically preceding the passage of the תוכחה, which predicts the retribution for non compliance with Torah legislation, but is the Torah’s vision of the ultimate idyllic future of the Jewish people on the soil of the Holy Land. Ed.]\n']"
Leviticus, 26,12,"['והתהלכתי בתוככם. The meaning of this reflexive conjugation is as if the Torah had written: “I will walk with you in whatever direction you are going, back and forth and sideways.” In other words, G’d says that He will not limit His benevolent presence to a single location or route of His choosing as it was as long as the Temple or Tabernacle stood, and only these locations were holy domains, the people having to come there if they wanted to experience sanctity and holiness. While it is true that this had been the primary objective in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.25"" data-ref=""Exodus 25"">Exodus chapter 25</a> when the command to build the Tabernacle had first been issued, this was only an initial step in regaining the closeness between G’d and Israel which had been shattered due to the sin of the golden calf. During the immediate period being ushered in at that time, the operating clause for such manifestation of holiness would the words אשר אועד לך שמה, “where I choose to manifest Myself” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.30.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 30:6"">Exodus 30,6</a>) Or <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.29.43"" data-ref=""Exodus 29:43"">Exodus 29,43</a> ונועדתי שמה לבני ישראל, “I will manifest Myself there to the Children of Israel.”<br>In the future, wherever the righteous would be found holiness would be present. This is the meaning of והתהלכתי בתוככם. At that time My glory will be manifest universally, not only within the confines of the Temple. This is the time of which <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.66.1-2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 66:1-2"">Isaiah 66, 1-2</a> said “The heaven is My throne, and the earth My footstool.”', 'והייתי לכם לאלוקים, I will be a special G’d, yours alone. You will not have recourse to any other “leader,” any intermediary who will have an input into shaping your destiny. This is why your eternal existence will not again be threatened. This is the true significance of being בצלמי ובדמותי, “in My image (and in My form.”), meaning as it had been G’d’s original intention. This intention had been briefly realised again at the revelation at Mount Sinai, only to have again been aborted when the golden calf was made and the people danced around it. When G’d said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.6.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 6:7"">Exodus 6,7</a> “I will take you to be My people and to be your G’d, He had meant the restoration of man’s original perfection as he had been when first created, becoming the gift of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai. <br>On the other hand, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.29.12"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 29:12"">Deuteronomy 29,12</a> when G’d also speaks of the result of the covenant being that He will be the G’d of the Jewish people, He did not refer to such lofty ideals at that time. At that point the Torah was satisfied with ensuring the uninterrupted function of the Tabernacle as the home of the Shechinah on earth. This was the reduced objective we had heard about in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.29.45"" data-ref=""Exodus 29:45"">Exodus 29,45</a> when G’d spoke about making His residence among the Jewish people in that Tabernacle, not wherever they would be in areas beyond the Tabernacle. G’d would indeed be the Jewish people’s G’d, with all that this entails in terms of His personal providence, but He would not be described as dwelling “among” them, or “within” them, depending on how we want to understand the word בתוכם. However, we would be His people, if all our efforts would be designed to carry out G’d’s will to the extent that He had revealed it to us. After all, every people does no less than this for its king of flesh and blood.\n']"

Our sages have often stated that the Israelites who worshipped idols were perfectly aware that these idols were totally helpless, could not help themselves, much less those who professed to worship them. If they worshipped them in spite of knowing that they were all nothing but sham, it was only in order to anger G’d. They did so in order to be free to practice incest in public.

The prophet Ezekiel, in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.20.32"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 20:32"">Ezekiel 20,32</a> already challenges the people who would use the fact that they were now in exile, apparently abandoned by their G’d, as an excuse do divest themselves of the claims the Torah makes on them.

Numbers, 1,4,"['איש ראש לבית אבותיו, this is emphasised to show that no one challenged the authority and authenticity of the people representing themselves as the “heads of his family.”  When the count occurred, אתכם in the presence of the family heads each one testifying to the age of the individuals concerned, no one would dare to challenge the accuracy of the data provided by the family head.\n']"
Numbers, 1,18,"['ויתילדו על משפחותם, seeing the purpose of the count was to know who would have to join the ranks of those going to war, it was important to have genealogically pure men, not any who were the product of forbidden unions. Knowledge that they were the children of unblemished parentage would protect them when exposed to the dangers present in any war and battle. We find a similar thought expressed in Kidushin 76 that “the credentials of people recorded in the king’s register need not be investigated any further.” On folio 70 of the Talmud there we also find the statement that the Shechinah does not rest protectively except over genetically “pure” families.']"
Numbers, 1,20,"['בכור ישראל. He had not lost his status in the books kept in heaven as he had repented his sin as testified in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.35.22-23"" data-ref=""Genesis 35:22-23"">Genesis 35,22-23</a> commencing with the otherwise unnecessary words ויהיו בני יעקב שנים עשר, “that Yaakov’s sons remained twelve.” This was in contrast to Reuven’s birthright privileges here on earth having been revoked in favour of Joseph.']"
Numbers, 1,44,"['אלה הפקודים, every single one of the aforementioned had been personally counted by Moses and Aaron.']"
Numbers, 1,45,"['ויהיו כל פקודי....כל יוצאי בישראל צבא, none were over sixty years of age, as people of that age and beyond were not allowed to go out to war. We know this from Baba Batra 121 concerning Yair ben Menashe and others included in the count mentioned there. The decree that the generation of the spies would have to die in the desert applied only to the ones between 20-60. Those younger or older at the time of the spies’ trip were exempt from this decree.']"
Numbers, 1,47,"['לא התפקדו, were not counted by the officials appointed to conduct the census, nor did they count themselves. (compare Ibn Ezra on this) They had not prepared themselves as had the other people for coming to the assembly point and providing documents proving their identity and genealogy. What is mentioned in this verse all referred to the time prior to G’d announcing in verse 49 that the tribe of Levi should not be included in this census. The Levites had been awaiting instructions concerning how they were going to be counted. The reason they had reason to wonder was that the tribe of Levi had not been mentioned in the list of tribes during this entire chapter when the Torah referred to “each man per each tribe” in verse 4.']"
Numbers, 1,49,"['אך את מטה לוי, even though I had said “count all the heads of the community of Israel,” (verse 2) and it was understood that the Levites were included in this, they are distinct from the other tribes in that they will be counted separately, according to different criteria, such as —', 'לא תפקוד different age groups, and —', 'ואת ראשם לא תשא when you compute the total number of people in the general census their number will not be included.']"
Numbers, 1,50,"['ואתה הפקד, the commandment to count them is repeated to make clear that they are in a class by themselves. The reason was that only this census rated as a holy activity.']"
Numbers, 1,53,"['והלוים יחנו סביבת, this is another difference between the Levites and the other tribes, i.e. that they were to be encamped immediately adjacent to the sacred domain of the Tabernacle. Whereas the other tribes encamped each around its flag, the Levites’ “flag” was the Tabernacle.']"
Numbers, 2,17,"['ונסע...אהל מועד...בתוך המחנה. Between the two flags which have already been mentioned.', 'כאשר יחנו, as soon as half the camp had arrived at the next destination the Tabernacle would be put together again so that it would again be situated in the center of the entire encampment. This was possible as the Kehatites traveled immediately behind the flag of Reuven’s segment of the army, and they had been transporting the vital contents of the Tabernacle. We know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.25.22"" data-ref=""Exodus 25:22"">Exodus 25,22</a> that these parts of the Tabernacle were the essential ones, as G’d had made His communicating with Moses dependent on the presence of these furnishings. It follows that the meaning of the words כאשר יחנו can also be understood as “as soon as they (these parts) would come to rest.” The Tabernacle whether in its functional form, fully erected, or in its pre-fabricated parts only, always remained in the center of the Israelites whether the latter were on the move or encamped.\n']"
Numbers, 2,33,"['והלוים לא התפקדו, also among the total of the remainder of the tribes.', ""כאשר צוה ה' את משה. As G’d had said in 1,49 “do not count them as part of the Children of Israel.”\n""]"
Numbers, 3,1,"[""ואלה תולדות אהרן ומשה ביום דבר ה' אל משה. At the time when G’d set the tribe of Levi apart from the other tribes, some of them having to transport the Tabernacle on its journeys, some to perform service in and around the Tabernacle and to pronounce blessings in G’d’s name. Nadav and Avihu were included in the people described as Levites.""]"
Numbers, 3,2,"['ואלה שמות בני אהרן; each one of them was mentioned by his name, i.e. not only because he was a son of an illustrious father such as Aaron.']"
Numbers, 3,3,"['הכהנים המשוחים, future priests were not described in such terms as they were not anointed while the High Priest was alive. אשר מלא ידם לכהן, the reason why the sons of Aaron were also anointed with the oil of anointment was to enable them to perform priestly duties, as otherwise there would have been no priests other that Aaron, no one having been born as priest to a father who was a priest. Had they been born after Aaron’s appointment, they would not have required such anointing as heredity would have sufficed.\n']"
Numbers, 3,4,"['בהקריבם אש זרה, this was the only blemish they had been guilty of.', 'ובנים לא היו להם, if they had had sons, the sons would have been their replacements if they had been physically and mentally suitable.', 'ויכהן אלעזר ואיתמר, they had been given authority to substitute for their father in the Tabernacle if the need would arise, by the command of G’d.', 'על פני אהרן אביהם, during the lifetime of Aaron his sons had already been anointed. The death of two of them, as well as their replacing their father as High Priest was not at Aaron’s command, even though he was the High Priest. [if I understand the author correctly, he means that contrary to a king appointing a son as his successor, the High Priest is not entitled to appoint his own successor. Ed.] None of what is reported here is of significance for future generations as ordinary priests were not anointed, whereas the position of High Priest was not a position that could be inherited.\n']"
Numbers, 3,6,"['ושרתו אותו. Seeing that the ultimate responsibility for anything connected with the Tabernacle was Aaron’s, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.18.1"" data-ref=""Numbers 18:1"">Numbers 18,1</a> אתה ובניך ובית אביך אתך תשאו את עון המקדש ואתה ובניך אתך תשאו את עון כהנתכם, “you and your sons and the house of your father with you will have to carry the sin or guilt of the Temple; and you and your sons with you will have to be responsible for any sin/guilt involving the priesthood you have been appointed to.” As a result of these verses, the service performed by the Levites was in the nature of being assistants to the priests, comprising standing guard over the Tabernacle, protecting it against the entry of people not in a fit state for one reason or another. They had to ensure that the vessels of the Tabernacle remained not only in good condition but were not stolen, etc. The second half of that verse in chapter 18 refers to no non-priests being allowed within the sacred domain reserved for either the priests or even only the High Priest.\n']"
Numbers, 3,7,"['משמרת כל העדה לפני אהל מועד לעבוד את עבודת המשכן, to assist in the tasks needed to perform the service in the Temple properly. Had it not been for the sin of the golden calf, it would have been the duty/privilege of the members of the Supreme Court, Sanhedrin, to carry out the tasks now allocated to the Levites.']"
Numbers, 3,8,"['משמרת בני ישראל לעבוד את עבודת המשכן, the auxiliary aspects of the service in the Tabernacle, to carry, to sing, etc; these tasks, if not for the sin of the golden calf, would have been assigned to ordinary members of the people at large instead of being reserved exclusively for the Levites.']"
Numbers, 3,9,"['נתונים נתונים המה לו, all their (the Levites’) service was to be performed at the instruction of Aaron, to whom the Levites had been delegated by the people. ', 'מאת בני ישראל, who in turn obligated themselves to compensate their delegates, the Levites, by giving them the tithes of their crops.\n']"
Numbers, 3,10,"['ושמרו את כהנתם, concerning all matters involving the altar, the dividing curtain and what is beyond it, to ensure that the Levites not enter any of these domains.', 'והזר הקרב, any unauthorised person entering these domains will be legally executed (if he did it deliberately after due warning).\n']"
Numbers, 3,12,"[' תחת כל בכור, as a redemption.']"
Numbers, 3,13,"['כי לי כל בכור, as the Temple service used to be the duty of the respective firstborn in each family.ביום הכותי כל בכור בארץ מצרים הקדשתי לי כל בכור בישראל, although at the time when the firstborn in Egypt were killed, the Jewish firstborn had been guilty of death also, as had been the firstborn of that entire generation. They were singled out for this penalty as they were the most honoured people of their time, and as such served as role models for others. There was no special merit due to which they would have been spared, as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.19.15"" data-ref=""Genesis 19:15"">Genesis 19,15</a> where the angels warned Lot not to remain in Sodom lest he too would be killed on account of the company he kept.<br> G’d, in sanctifying them, i.e. placing them on a spiritually elevated pedestal so that they would not partake in all manner of secular pursuits, justified sparing them at that time. Now that, due to the sin of the golden calf, they had forfeited this spiritually elevated status, they had to be “redeemed” in order to resume life on a more mundane level than that for which they had been destined. This is the meaning of וכל בכור אדם תפדה, “you shall redeem every human male firstborn.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.13.13"" data-ref=""Exodus 13:13"">Exodus 13,13</a>).<br>We must not make the mistake of thinking that seeing that this verse was written before the sin of the golden calf, that the firstborn had already been subject to redemption at that time, i.e that G’d had despised them as not fit to offer the sacrificial offerings. On the contrary, the “redemption” of which <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.13.13"" data-ref=""Exodus 13:13"">Exodus 13,13</a> speaks, i.e. [without a simultaneous substitution of others in their place, Ed.] was only in order to permit these firstborn to also pursue a regular lifestyle when they would not be performing service in the Temple, etc. Without “redemption” every object that has been sanctified is out of bounds for any mundane use whether passive or active, as it would constitute a demeaning of its holiness. (compare Chulin 137)', 'מאדם עד בהמה לי יהיו, from now on, humans have to be redeemed, animals to be slaughtered and their blood and fat offered on the altar.']"
Numbers, 4,5,"['בנסוע המחנה, after the cloud above it had already withdrawn, for prior to that they were forbidden to enter the Tabernacle.']"
Numbers, 4,10,['ונתנו על המוט; after that the Levites were permitted to carry all these parts.']
Numbers, 4,16,"['ופקדת אלעזר, to issue orders who was to do what; i.e. who was to carry which parts of the Tabernacle.', 'פקדת כל המשכן; responsibility for the whole Tabernacle at the time when they broke camp to start their journeys and again when it came time to make camp.\n']"
Numbers, 4,18,"['אל תכריתו, do not allow the procedure of carrying parts of the Tabernacle to be a free for all, the one first on the spot carrying the part he chooses to, for if you do this the resulting chaos will lead to destruction, to death. Such chaotic conditions will inevitably lead to desecration of holy things, holy objects, with tragic results, i.e. loss of life. Our sages illustrated what is meant when describing the race between priests to be the first to carry out the cleaning of the ashes off the top of the altar. (compare Yuma 23-24).']"
Numbers, 4,19,"['ושמו איש איש על עבודתו ואל משאו, assign to each of them his specific duty in order to avoid a free for all. By doing this, you will insure that each Levite will wait patiently until his turn comes to carry out his assigned duty.']"
Numbers, 4,20,"['ולא יבאו לראות, by having a previously assigned roster of individual duties you will avoid that someone will see things forbidden to be seen by him, as a result of which he would have to die. He will avoid watching the priests covering the holy vessels, something which would cause their death.']"
Numbers, 4,24,"['לעבוד ולמשא. The former, לעבוד, while the people were encamped; the latter while the people were journeying. ולמשא, at the time of the journeys. Seeing that earlier when the Torah said:ומשמרת בני גרשון באהל מועד, (3,25) it spoke about their carrying out their function at the time of the people being encamped, the Torah also stated that everything which was under their control while the people were encamped remained under their control during the journeys.\n']"
Numbers, 4,26,"['ועבדו, during the periods when the Israelites were encamped their duties consisted of watching over all the vessels which formed part of the auxiliary equipment of the Tabernacle, i.e. אשר יעשה להם, “watching over all that would be done with them or to them.” For instance, seeing to it that the tools enabling the pegs to be firmly implanted in the earth so that the wind could not blow away the carpets forming the roof of the Tabernacle would be in good shape and position.\n']"
Numbers, 4,27,"['לכל משאם, at the time of the journey,', 'ולכל עבודתם, when the people would be encamped.\n']"
Numbers, 5,6,"[""'למעול מעל בה, our traditional sources already told us that the subject is robbery from a proselyte who dies intestate before the robber confessed and made restitution. The robber had committed an act of desecrating the name of G’d in the eyes of the proselyte who must be appalled that a natural born Jew could be guilty of such a deed. This is why the sin of the robber in this verse is described as a “transgression against something sacred.”""]"
Numbers, 5,8,"[""'המושב לה, when the original owner of the stolen property no longer exists, it is proper to make restitution to the “boss” of the person from whom it has been taken, his “boss” being none other than G’d. [The author considers any property owned by any one on earth as only “on loan” from the real owner, from G’d. Ed.] Our sages phrase this as “when the servant dies he has to return it to the master.” (Baba Batra 51)""]"
Numbers, 5,9,"['וכל תרומה, according to Sifrey 5 the t’rumah of which the Torah speaks here are the first fruit which have to be offered to G’d, as it is customary for the owner of fields or orchards to present these first fruit of each year’s produce (seven species) and to recite the appropriate benediction when presenting same in the Temple. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.26.3"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 26:3"">Deuteronomy 26,3</a>). Here the Torah tells us that just as property stolen from a proselyte who died intestate, which was described as “being returned to G’d,” winds up in the hands of the priest, i.e. G’d’s agent, so the bikkurim, the farmer’s gift to G’d has also been assigned by G’d to the priest of the respective roster on His behalf.']"
Numbers, 5,10,"['ואיש את קדשיו לו יהיו, however other kinds of “holy” gifts, namely ordinary tithes and trumot, may be given by the owner to whichever Levite or priest he chooses, not necessarily the priest officiating in the Temple at the time the gift is presented.', 'איש אשר יתן לכהן, once the owner has given “his” holy portion to the priest it becomes secular, mundane, not encumbered with any restrictions. Rather, לו יהיה, it is exclusively “his,” neither the previous owners nor other priests can legally deprive him of it.\n']"
Numbers, 5,12,"['כי תשטה אשתו, she deviates from the path of chastity.', 'ומעלה בו מעל, she has profaned what is holy to G’d, that which He loves, marital union, by embracing and kissing someone other than her husband. (compare Maleachi 2,11)\n']"
Numbers, 5,13,"['ושכב איש אותה, and another man has lain with her It is characteristic of the evil urge to cause the sinner to proceed from a relatively mild sin to ever more serious sins.', 'ונעלם מעיני אישה, even though there had been indications of mistrust, jealousy, etc., her latest indiscretion remained hidden from the eyes of her husband. It is as if his eyes had been too weak to see what was going on. Had her husband been aware of her infidelity, the waters would not even have the power to bring this to light. Our sages have made this quite clear (Sifrey 7).', 'ונסתרה, she had subsequently hidden, and this fact had become known to her husband.\n']"

In spite of this, והביא האיש את אשתו, we do not say that seeing that her husband had sat by silently while his wife had behaved unchastely, accusing her in his heart without saying a word, that this is proof of the husband’s bad attitude and we should therefore ignore his jealousy seeing he had allowed matters to get to the point where she had slept with another man; neither do we ignore his jealousy if she had not given him cause as something not worth paying attention to.

When the father heard about it he sent the following message to his son: “are there no opportunities to perform such charitable deeds in our town that I had to send you to Tiberias to do this?” (Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1,7) The point is that there are other people who can perform the charitable deed of burying the dead so that the services of the Nazirite are not required.

Numbers, 6,8,"['\'קדוש הוא לה. He will merit the light available for those enjoying eternal life, as well as be able to instruct the spiritual leaders of his generation.

What he meant was that he agreed with Chanah his wife’s vow that the child she would bear would spend his life on earth as a Nazirite. He did not add any additional request regarding the child that would be born to them. If G’d would allow Chanah’s prayer and vow to come true this would be more than enough satisfaction for him.']"
Numbers, 6,13,"['יביא אותו, our sages in B’rachot 8 have already explained this to mean that the Nazirite is to bring himself, as it were. Normally, when someone is being prepared for a higher status than that he had attained in the past, such a person is being “brought” to his new assignment by someone superior to himself. This is why the person afflicted with tzoraat is brought to the Temple. Here. the Nazir presents himself in the Temple instead of being brought, i.e. presented by someone superior. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.14.2"" data-ref=""Leviticus 14:2"">Leviticus 14,2</a> concerning the צרוע, and concerning the Sotah where the Torah had also written in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.5.15"" data-ref=""Numbers 5:15"">Numbers 5,15</a> that the husband was to bring his wife to the priest.

Contrary to all this, the Nazirite at the end of his term who will once more begin to shave the hairs of his face and head, thus becoming “a new man,” brings himself. The reason is simple. There is no one on a higher spiritual niveau who could act as the one “bringing” him, i.e. presenting him.']"

Numbers, 7,10,"['ויקריבו הנשיאים את חנכת המזבח, they sanctified it.', 'ויקריבו הנשיאים את קרבנם לפני המזבח, after they had sanctified it as a sacrifice the brought it before the altar.\n']"
Numbers, 7,13,"[""'וקרבנו קערת כסף אחת, וגו; each one of the princes offered all these components as part of his offering. They comprised: a burnt offering, עולה, a gift offering, מנחה, a sin offering, חטאת, as well as peace offerings, שלמים, and incense, קטורת. The reason why the Torah does not simply lump all these offerings together but tells us separately, 12 times what each prince’s offering consisted of, is that each one had intended thereby to atone for all the sins he was aware of that members of his tribe had committed, had been guilty of. Each prince performed the סמיכה, the act of placing all his weight on the animal becoming the sin offering on behalf of the members of his tribe guilty of sins requiring such a sin offering to atone for their sins. This was a regular procedure when communal offerings were being brought.""]"
Numbers, 7,84,"['זאת חנכת המזבח, when we compare the consecration of the altar of the Tabernacle to that of the consecration of Solomon’s Temple, this appears as so insignificant as to be hardly worth mentioning. (compare Kings I chapter 8)']"
Numbers, 7,89,"['ובבא משה אל אהל מועד לדבר אתו וישמע את הקול, even though in physical terms the Tabernacle was insignificant compared to the magnificent structure Solomon had built, in terms of spiritual achievement the Tabernacle far outranked Solomon’s Temple, which in  turn outranked the second Temple.  During the entire period of the second Temple (420 years) not a single prophet had been able to enter the Temple and there to hear the voice of G’d at any given moment. If at this point Moses was able to do this it proved that G’d had approved the consecration and had drawn near Moses as the shepherd of the Jewish people. In spite of all this spiritual grandeur of the Tabernacle in the desert and the clear manifestation of G’d’s presence over it or in it, even this was a far cry from the presence of G’d in the Israelite camp during the period of the revelation at Mount Sinai, and the 40 days before the sin of the golden calf. Once Moses entered the Tabernacle he was able to hear the voice of G’d, something he had been able to hear all the time before the sin of the golden calf, and without the benefit of the Tabernacle and the hallowed ground it stood on. ', 'מדבר, read “mi-dabber,” talking to Himself. [According to Moreh Nevuchim 1,68 and in accordance with Aristotele’s concept of G’d, there is no division between subject and predicate in the sphere of understanding something, defining it, actively or passively when we speak of G’d, as is the case when we speak of His creatures. A creature, by definition is subjective vis-à-vis itself, G’d is never subjective, always objective. Having said this you will understand that the translation of G’d “speaking to Himself,” i.e. being both at the receiving end and at the initiating end at the same time is not a contradiction in terms.” Ed.] <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.16.4"" data-ref=""Proverbs 16:4"">Proverbs 16,4</a> כל פעל ה\' למענהו, reveals that in the final analysis, all that G’d does has an intelligent purpose known to Him and approved by Him, so much so that the fact that He has seen fit to do it automatically means that it is beneficial for His universe and those in it. We need to keep this in mind whenever we read a line such as וידבר ה\'. It is as if the Torah reminded us that the One described as מדבר\n']"
Numbers, 8,2,"['בהעלותך את הנרות, when you kindle the six lamps,', 'אל מול פני המנורה, facing the lamp on the center shaft; this means that the wick is to be inclined towards this center shaft so that the flames will point in this direction from the respective sides of the menorah.  Then, and only then,', 'יאירו שבעת הנרות, all seven lamps will fulfill their function of illuminating and being the conduits of spiritual light descending on to the Jewish people. [obviously, the individual lamps would be able to provide physical light before being positioned in the manner described. Ed.]<br> The mussar, allegorical lesson conveyed by the lights of the menorah is us that only by the “right” side representing preoccupation with eternal values, life in the future, working together with the “left” side which represents the concerns with physical life on our planet, will we be able to attain our purpose on earth. Our sages in Chulin 92 phrased it thus: אלמלי עלייא לא מתקיימא אתכליא, “if not for the input from celestial regions, spiritual input, the creatures on earth would not be able to survive at all.” [I have not found this precise quote, but it means more literally that if there were no wise people who could tutor the ignorant, the world as we know it would collapse. Ed.] In order for this universe to function as G’d wanted it to, all social levels of the people have to make their respective contributions. <br>A major function of the combined activity by the “tutored and the ignorant” is to ensure that G’d’s name would be hailed, revered and enthusiastically acknowledged by every segment of mankind, all of His creatures. An example of such a thing happening is found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.19.8"" data-ref=""Exodus 19:8"">Exodus 19,8</a> ויענו כל העם יחדו ויאמרו כל אשר דבר ה\' נעשה, the emphasis here being on the word יחדו, i.e. all the people in unison would combine to carry out G’d’s will.\n']"
Numbers, 8,4,"['וזה מעשה המנורה מקשה, the very composition of the menorah as a single chunk of gold, with all its lights facing the lamp on the central shaft, symbolises this united endeavour to serve G’d, i.e. to look towards the spiritual light  as symbolised by that in the center of the menorah, its “trunk.” המנורה מקשה, to underline the unity, the whole people jointly striving to attain the same spiritual objective.\n']"
Numbers, 8,14,"['והבדלת את הלוים, this “separation” will express itself in their having separate areas in which they would encamp, i.e. the Levites who were members of the people who had participated in the Exodus and their children growing up in the desert; ', 'והיו לי הלוים, and both they and their descendants, (when they would not all live next to the Temple) would be for “Me,” i.e. ready and prepared to carry out their duties as Levites.\n']"
Numbers, 8,15,"[' ואחרי כן יבאו הלוים, the ones existing now.']"
Numbers, 8,16,"['כי נתונים נתונים המה לי, they have devoted themselves to me and My service, as the Torah testified in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.26"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:26"">Exodus 32,26</a> when all of them responded to Moses’ call that whoever was for the Lord should assemble around him. מתוך בני ישראל, they are also “נתונים” by the Children of Israel who will provide them with a livelihood by means of giving them their tithes, i.e. the מעשר ראשון 10% of their harvest after hey had set aside the t’rumah for the priests.', 'תחת פטרה כל רחם, who had originally been assigned the duties now assumed by the Levites.\n']"
Numbers, 8,17,"['כי לי כל בכור, I had already owned the firstborn whose duty it had been to perform the tasks now given to the Levites. The reason that the firstborn had originally been charged with the duties was that they were the most distinguished members of their respective families and one delegates those to represent one before one’s lord and master, before G’d.', 'ביום הכותי כל בכור בארץ מצרים הקדשתי, the reason why I required them now to undergo the procedure of being redeemed from their sanctity and the duties that were part of this that from the day I had sanctified them, was that they were not supposed to engage in mundane activities, such as earning a livelihood, at all.<br> Firstborn male animals that are acceptable as sacrifices on the altar may not be used for mundane purposes, i.e their owners must neither let them perform work, not shear their wool and use it for themselves. This was in order for Me to have demonstrated their holy character. These regulations were imposed in order to justify these firstborn not being killed along the firstborn of the rest of the Egyptians and their herds. Having been part of the Egyptian culture, and having been the most distinguished in their respective families, they should, ordinarily, have become part of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.78.49"" data-ref=""Psalms 78:49"">Psalms 78,49</a> calls the משלחת מלאכי רעים, “the wrath inflicted by the band of deadly messengers.” The surviving firstborn humans and their offspring, in order not to lead a life of idleness, therefore have to be “redeemed,” so that they can at least lead normal lives. G’d therefore accomplished this by the stratagem known as פדיון, redemption.\n']"
Numbers, 8,18,"['ואקח את הלוים תחת כל בכור, a regulation applicable only during the generation addressed by Moses at the time, a one-time procedure, as we explained previously.']"
Numbers, 8,19,"['ואתנה את הלוים, since they are by themselves “given” to perform service for Me, they are now at the disposal of Aaron and his sons, My delegates on earth.', 'לעבוד את עבודת בני ישראל באהל מועד, to perform the very duties which, previously, it had been the duty of the firstborn to perform on behalf of the Children of Israel.', 'ולכפר על בני ישראל, and to be the instrument of the people’s atonement by their accepting the tithes tendered them by the people so that they would be free to perform the duties G’d has now assigned to them. G’d had come to despise the firstborn, seeing that they participated also in the sin of the golden calf which had caused G’d so much grief.', ' ולא יהיה בבני ישראל נגף, both among the Israelites and among the Levites.', 'בגשת בני ישראל אל הקודש, the Israelites’ sin would be that of entering domains out of bounds to them, whereas the Levites’ sin would be allowing them  to do so without trying to prevent them from entering holy precincts. All of them would make themselves guilty and would die at the hands of G’d as spelled out in 18,3.\n']"
Numbers, 8,20,"['ויעש משה ואהרן וכל עדת בני ישראל ללוים, the prefix ל in the word ללוים means “on behalf of, in aid of them.” They assisted with the shaving, the laundering of their clothing, as well as in preparation of the requisite offering.', ""ככל אשר צוה ה' את משה ללוים. As G’d had commanded Moses that he, in turn, should command the Levites to do."", 'כן עשו להם בני ישראל, the wording reflects how promptly these instructions were carried out. They were so eager to please their Maker.\n']"
Numbers, 8,22,"[""כאשר צוה ה' את משה על הלוים, G’d had commanded that the task of the Levites would be to stand guard, to form the choir chanting the psalms and to carry the parts of the Tabernacle whenever the situation called for this. They would be assigned their immediate duties by Aaron and his sons."", 'כן עשו להם, Aaron and his sons would organise them, allocate to them their specific duties.\n']"
Numbers, 9,1,"['בחודש הראשון, after he had taken a census of the males fit for service in the army according to their ages. Moses was to make all the preparations necessary to arrange for the orderly entrance of the Israelites into the land of Canaan.<br>This involved first and foremost that the inhabitants of the camps of the Israelites be ritually pure in conformity with the Torah’s imperative that the army of the Jewish people when assembled must be holy (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.23.15"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 23:15"">Deuteronomy 23,15</a>). Needless to say that it must not contain people who had not cleansed themselves of their ritual impurity. They also had to be certain that no members of the Israelite camp was the product of an illegal union between people whose incestuous relationship carried the karet penalty. The purpose of all this was that G’d’s Shechinah would rest on the troops, and that therefore victory would be assured and casualties minimized. <br>The Talmud in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.11"" data-ref=""Sotah 11"">Sotah 11</a> and 31 relates that the Jewish people had 4 virtues to their credit on account of which they merited entering and conquering the land of Canaan already at that time if the sin of the spies had not intervened. We know that Moses was convinced that the conquest of the land of Canaan was at hand when he asked his father-in-law Yitro to remain with him and to partake in that event. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.10.29"" data-ref=""Numbers 10:29"">Numbers 10,29</a>) <br>These merits were: 1) the altar had been successfully consecrated, the offerings of the Jewish people were being accepted by G’d. 2) the Levites had been consecrated. 3) The Jewish people had demonstrated eagerness when observing the anniversary of the Exodus by performing the required ceremonies in difficult circumstances. 4) They had followed their G’d to an inhospitable desert even though they had no idea if and when the cloud would lift and indicate that they were suddenly to break camp. Their entire situation was such that sometimes they would remain in the same spot for months or years, whereas other times they would break camp and re-establish camp after only 24 hours, all of which involved a tremendous upheaval when we consider that we speak about two and a half to three million souls. <br>In order to describe the various merits the Jewish people had in their favour at the time the Torah told us at this point about these events instead of relating them in chronological order, as we might have expected. Consecration of the altar occurred in the first month of the second year, so did the consecration of the Levites, and so did the celebration of the second Passover. Seeing that the beginning of the Book of Numbers speaks of events in the second month of that year, we could have questioned the Torah’s sequence. However, the Torah had a purpose in delaying the report about the last mentioned events in order to demonstrate that had it not been for the disastrous mission of the spies everything would have been in place for an immediate ascent to the Holy Land. The entire paragraph is another illustration of the principle known as אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה, that the Torah is not a record of events in chronological order. The Torah most certainly is very orderly, has been written after careful consideration, but G’d, the author, had decided that “order” does not necessarily mean “chronological sequence.”\n']"
Numbers, 9,2,"['ויעשו בני ישראל את הפסח, apart from the procedures reported as having taken place on the eighth day of the consecration of the Tabernacle, and the consecration of the princes between the first and twelfth of the month of Nissan, 2 days later the whole nation observed the Passover. They did not feel that they had become free from doing so seeing that they had just finished a string of rituals as a result of which they were on a spiritual “high,” full of joy. This was in contrast to the consecration of Solomon’s Temple, on the occasion of which, according to our sages in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Moed_Katan.9"" data-ref=""Moed Katan 9"">Moed Katan 9</a>, Solomon ordered a dispensation of the Day of Atonement seeing that the people were on such a spiritual “high” on account of that event.']"
Numbers, 9,7,"['אנחנו טמאים לנפש אדם למה נגרע, seeing that the ritual impurity we have incurred was incurred in the process of our fulfilling a positive commandment, why should the result of this be the misdemeanour of not fulfilling such an important commandment as observing the Passover at the appointed time?', 'במועדו, seeing that this is a commandment which can only be fulfilled at its appointed date?\n']"
Numbers, 9,14,"['חקה אחת יהיה לכם, here while you are in the desert.', 'ולגר ולאזרח הארץ, once you will have settled in the land of Israel.\n']"
Numbers, 9,17,"['ואחרי כן יסעו, after the cloud had lifted off the Tabernacle the people would march, following its direction.', 'ובמקום אשר ישכון שם הענן שם יחנו, the Torah records this in order to praise the Israelites for following G’d in the desert regardless of the site where the cloud stopped being a desolate inhospitable place.']"
Numbers, 9,19,"["". ושמרו בני ישראל את משמרת ה', the reason why the Torah repeats this fact a second time is to emphasise that even when the location selected by the cloud was not only inhospitable, but the cloud remained there for a long period, the Israelites did not grumble or protest this fact. They did not start journeying on their own, looking for a more suitable place to encamp.""]"
Numbers, 9,20,"['ויש אשר יהיה הענן ימים מספר, now the Torah reports the same matter for the third time as sometimes the encampment of the Jewish people was in an area which was pleasant, offered grazing for their animals and in spite of this after a day or two the cloud lifted, something which must have caused the people discontent [especially after the decree that the generation of the spies would die in the desert and they could not expect even if they moved to enter their ultimate destination. Ed.] Still, and this is why the Torah repeats the basic fact, the Israelites never complained about the movements of the cloud. Whatever the situation,', ""על פי ה' יחנו, they journeyed in accordance with G’d’s instructions, regardless if it suited them or not. "", ""ועל פי ה' יסעו, even if the location of their camp had suited them very well.\n""]"
Numbers, 9,21,"['ויש אשר יהיה הענן מערב עד בוקר, this is the fourth time that the manner in which the cloud operated is being mentioned, to show that it was impossible to predict with any degree of probability how long they would stay in one location. Sometimes, only overnight. This was not even time enough to pitch their tents, much less to erect the Tabernacle. The principal reason this detail was mentioned is to make clear that the journeys never started at night.']"
Numbers, 9,22,"['או יומים או חדש או ימים, this is now already the fifth time that the Torah belabours the subject of these journeys, something totally unprecedented. It alerts us to how sometimes the people did not even have time to send their beasts to graze, whereas on other occasions they had to dismantle everything at very short notice, any plans they had made having to be abandoned.']"
Numbers, 9,23,"[""על פי ה' יחנו, even when the encampment was so short-lived and the time for the to arrange their affairs was so short."", ""ועל פי ה' יסעו, when the dismantling in advance of the next journey would be more time consuming seeing that they had been in the same location for a long time, they still hastened and packed up to follow the cloud.\n""]"
Numbers, 10,2,"['עשה לך שתי חצוצרות כסף, seeing that the immediate plan was for the people to journey to the Holy Land without delay, G’d gave the commandment for the trumpets to be used as “Royal trumpet blasts,” announcing the moving of the Tabernacle to a new location, or announcing the arrival of the Tabernacle at its next location. The trumpets would also be blown before battles, as we know from verse 9.', 'והיו לך למקרא העדה, to assemble the people or their leaders in front of the Tabernacle. G’d wanted that the trumpets be used to render honour to the king.\n']"
Numbers, 10,5,"['ותקעתם תרועה ונסעו המחנות החונים קדמה, seeing that this flag also had the carriers of the Tabernacle in its wake.']"
Numbers, 10,6,"['ותקעתם תרועה שנית, as a result of which the second “flag” would start journeying, the ones that were positioned to the south. This “camp” was accompanied by the Levites carrying the sacred vessels.', 'תרועה יתקעו למסעיהם, this had to be spelled out as both the tekiah sounds and the teruah sounds would be blown by the trumpets in conjunction with the journeying of the camps. The former sounds to make sure the people would all be assembled in their assigned spots, the latter to ensure that the Levites were in position with their respective carts, etc. Just as the people in order to assemble were called by means of the tekiah, so the princes when they were to assemble were called by means of the tekiah blasts, without the teruah blast.\n']"
Numbers, 10,11,"['בחודש השני בעשרים בחודש, after the ritually impure had purified themselves and had brought their Passover offering on the 14th of the second month, the trumpets were constructed so that Moses could use them to call the people to mobilize for their journey away from Mount Sinai. The Torah informs us of the order in which the 4 army units and their flags were marching and how all this was organized with the help of the trumpets. It also describes the manner in which the trumpets were used on different occasions at the Temple and during times of war. When the cloud lifted off the Tabernacle it began its journey in the direction of Kadesh Barnea, which was the first town in the land of Israel which the Israelites encountered on that journey, described as the journey across “the great and awesome desert” in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.1.19"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 1:19"">Deuteronomy 1,19</a>, when Moses is quoted as recalling: “we arrived at Kadesh Barnea.”']"

If your children depart also you will be desecrating the name of the Lord among the nations as they will say: “if Yitro would have seen any merit in this religion surely he and his sons would not have abandoned them!” Both Yitro and his sons agreed with this argument of Moses so that in the end only Yitro returned to his country, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.18.27"" data-ref=""Exodus 18:27"">Exodus 18,27</a> “Moses saw his father-in-law Yitro off, and he went by himself back to his own country.” There is no question that his children remained with the Jewish people, as the Book of Judges testifies when writing about “the children of the Keyni, the father-in-law of Moses, having previously ascended from the city of palms with the tribe of Yehudah.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Judges.1.16"" data-ref=""Judges 1:16"">Judges 1,16</a>). \n']"

G’d was cautioning Moses that by allowing the people to select the spies themselves, that if they chose unsuitable candidates and they came back with a faulty report, the people would blame G’d for what was wrong with the country instead of the inadequate ability of the spies to correctly evaluate what they had seen. Once the blame would be laid at G’d’s doorstep it would be impossible to do teshuvah. In the event, the people did teshuvah when they said “we have sinned against You,” as reported in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.1.41"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 1:41"">Deuteronomy 1,41</a> As far as the spies whom Moses sent out were concerned, while it is true that they were guilty in bringing about the refusal of the people to undertake the campaign to conquer the land, and all this was due to a lack of faith in G’d, they did report truthfully on the excellence of the land and they brought back with them proof of it.

Their fault lay in their asserting that the country could not be conquered by the Jewish people. Once the people realised that the problem had been their own lack of faith and not any shortcoming they had ascribed to G’d, the way was paved for repentance to become acceptable. They immediately reversed themselves, offering to ascend and to participate in the conquest of the land. (compare verse 41 in our chapter) They prayed and cried to G’d regarding their sin, but G’d did not accept their prayer. Their sin had consisted of a desecration of the Lord’s name in public, something that cannot be atoned for except after the death of the guilty party. G’d had already alluded to this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.34"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:34"">Exodus 32,34</a> in connection with the sin of the golden calf when He had said וביום פקדי ופקדתי, “on the day when I mete out justice (literally “remember” i.e. review the deceased deeds, etc.) I will also judge, etc.” In other words, this atonement is reserved for people only posthumously.\n']"

The thing which is most baffling in the red heifer legislation is that most who is ritually pure becomes ritually contaminated by direct contact with it, although the whole purpose of the red heifer, its ash, etc., is to purify the people who had been ritually contaminated prior to being sprinkled with spring water containing its ashes.<br> However, when we examine the entire commandment in detail we find that some of the people concerned with that red heifer from the moment it has been burned after having been slaughtered become ritually contaminated, i.e. the person burning its carcass, the person collecting its ashes, as well as the ones throwing the cedar wood as well as the one using the hyssop and crimson thread. into its burnt ashes. The same applies to all those either touching the remains or carrying them. <br>By contrast, the person performing the sprinkling with the mixture of the ash and water as well as the one sanctifying the location where the red heifer is to be burned and the one lighting the fire prior to burning the slaughtered red heifer are not contaminated by their activities.<br> One of the principal conditions concerning the red heifer is the requirement that it must not even have 2 hairs that are white or black. The symbolism of the colour red is supplied by the prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.1.18"" data-ref=""Isaiah 1:18"">Isaiah 1,18</a> who writes that even if your sins are as red as certain type or wool dyed red they can become white as snow under certain conditions of remorse.<br> Our sages considered this line so important that they used to tie a red string to the entrance of the Sanctuary when the scapegoat was thrown down on the Day of Atonement. This string would turn white as proof that the people’s sins had been forgiven. When this happened the people would rejoice for the remainder of that day, whereas when it failed to turn white they would be greatly saddened. (Yuma 67)<br> We must remember that seeing that in the words of Solomon (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.30.5"" data-ref=""Proverbs 30:5"">Proverbs 30,5</a>) אמרת ה\' צרופה, “everything G’d has said is absolutely pure, refined,” He has no doubt kept in mind that all extremes are looked upon with disfavour so that His legislation must represent what Maimonides called the “golden mean.” Solomon himself described any perversion as something deserving total failure. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.28.18"" data-ref=""Proverbs 28:18"">Proverbs 28,18</a>). <br>Furthermore, we must remember that when attempting to rectify something that has become bent out of shape by merely bending it in the opposite direction partially this will not restore it to its previous condition, but that it must be reversed completely in order to eventually be straight again. This is a principle applied by physicians in healing physical ailments, a principle described in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Proverbs.20.30"" data-ref=""Proverbs 20:30"">Proverbs 20,30</a> as חבורות פצע תמריק ברע, “you must eradicate wounds and injuries by using (what appear to be) harmful remedies.” In other words, although the application of such remedies appears to run counter to the goal of preserving the golden mean, in such situations anything less drastic would never rectify the harm that had been caused by the injury. If similar means were to be applied to a completely healthy person they would, of course, be harmful instead of helpful. <br> A fifth consideration when contemplating the legislation in front of us is that the ash of the red heifer is effective in the context of ritual impurity only when the ritual impurity was caused by direct or indirect contact with a dead person’s body. Any other kind of ritual contamination, such as blood of menstruation, dead creeping things, and a number of other causes of such ritual defilements are not affected at all by the treatment here described.<br> We know that Torah by definition is designed to improve the quality of life of the people observing its laws. The Torah spells this out in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.47"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:47"">Deuteronomy 32,47</a> by writing: כי היא חייכם, “for it is your very life.” Anyone deviating from the laws of the Torah either is on the way to spiritual and physical death or is already at the point where, although he is walking around he is legally considered as dead. This is what the sages meant when they said that “the wicked are considered as dead although to all intents and purposes masquerading as alive.” (B’rachot 18).<br> A sixth consideration we must bear in mind in connection with this statute is that our sages consider the cedar wood as a symbol of haughtiness, arrogance, whereas they consider the hyssop herb as a symbol of humility (Erchin 16). When the two are paired with the red wool known as תולעת שני, each alludes to something sinful. [the subject in the Talmud there is that a Torah scholar, though he needs to practice humility, nevertheless must maintain a certain amount of dignity so that people dealing with him do not get the impression that he is merely a “wimp,” a feeble ineffective personality. [Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.5"" data-ref=""Sotah 5"">Sotah 5</a>, discussing a saying by Rabbi Hunna son of Rabbi Joshua and the M’iri on that saying. Ed.] Excessive humility in a person charged with leadership is as counterproductive as arrogance in an individual who has not been called upon to serve as a model to anyone.<br> Our sages quote as an example of excessive humility by a person in public life the humility of Israel’s first King, King Sha-ul, who was punished by G’d for not displaying authority when it needed to be displayed and allowed the common people to get away with making insulting remarks about him without disciplining them. (compare Yuma 22, reference to <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.10.27-11.13"" data-ref=""I Samuel 10:27-11:13"">Samuel I 10,27- 11,13</a>). Even later on in his reign when he excused himself for not having killed the best livestock of the Amalekites, Sha-ul cited his “fear” of the people a the reason why he did not protest the people’s taking these as loot, something which had been forbidden (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.15.17"" data-ref=""I Samuel 15:17"">Samuel I 15,17</a>). The prophet upraided him for behaving with his customary humility in public life, in the discharge of his duties as King.<br> Having said all this we come to the conclusion that although the whole red heifer legislation is a statute, a decree by G’d which must not be questioned, and we must not, G’d forbid, arrogate to ourselves to judge this legislation as suitable or not, seeing that everything G’d has said is pure and refined, it does teach some exceptionally valuable lessons even when looked at superficially as we have done. Although people like Moses and others on a high level of wisdom may have had an insight into the deeper meaning of this statute, we must learn what we can from what meets the eye.<br> An important lesson of value to every penitent for every sin committed appears to be the one that in trying to rectify one’s error, one must not content oneself to bend the “bent iron” back with the same amount of force it took to bend it out of shape in the first place, but one must strive to bend it beyond that so that in the future the likelihood of committing the same sin again will be reduced. {We encounter many בעלי תשובה in our daily lives who appear to relate to certain commandments with what appears to be exaggerated stringency. No doubt they have taken to heart what our author just explained about how to straighten out what has been bent out of shape. Ed.]<br> The red heifer legislation and its details appears among other objectives to indicate a path for the penitents how to make their repentance effective and lasting. The principal element is a complete reversal of the path in life which led him to commit the sins he became guilty of in the first place.<br> One of the lessons we learn from the details of this legislation is that whereas the method described in our portion is effective for the sinner who wishes to cleanse himself of his sins, i.e. to address himself to his problem by using extreme measures, such extremism when used by anyone other than a repentant sinner would have the opposite effect, i.e. it would make out the previously unblemished, pure, ritually clean person the very reverse, would contaminate him with ritual impurity (a euphemism for his sins.) The sinner is permitted, nay encouraged, commanded to use extreme measures in order to eventually achieve the balance represented by Maimonides’ ideal, the golden mean.<br> The <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Taanit.11"" data-ref=""Taanit 11"">Talmud Taanit, 11</a> in describing the procedure of the Nazir terminating his vow (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.6.11"" data-ref=""Numbers 6:11"">Numbers 6,11</a>) questions the line וכפר עליו מאשד חטא על הנפש, “he will thereby atone for the sin against his soul,” wanting to know what sin such a Nazir  could possibly have been guilty of? The answer given is that during the period of his abstinence from wine the Nazir experienced great distress over having to abstain from wine etc. It is reasoned that if the Torah describes a person who causes himself unnecessary distress in one small area of life as a sinner, how much more so will it consider a person who abstains from all food and drink a sinner? [the paragraph commenced with the sage Sh’muel describing people who voluntarily practice fasts as sinners. Ed.]<br> Consider the fact that the instrument the Torah provides for ritually cleansing the person who had become defiled through contact with a deceased person as a mixture of spring water and ash from the red heifer. This mixture is composed of two extremes, i.e. residues of pure water and fire. Merging these two extremes appears (symbolically) is an excellent way of regaining the path known as the golden mean. Using this combination teaches us that this golden mean is what G’d considers as טהרה, ritual purity, as spelled out in the Torah’s description of the function of the Day of Atonement, מכל חטאתיכם לפני ה\' תטהרו “you will become purified from all your sins before (against) the Lord,” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.16.30"" data-ref=""Leviticus 16:30"">Leviticus 16,30</a>).<br> We have to contemplate the fact that the Torah decrees that a person who has been defiled by contact with a dead person must not touch the Tabernacle of the Lord, (verse 13) and that he must not enter the airspace of the Tabernacle on pain of contaminating it, (verse 20). I believe the hidden meaning of this regulation is that anyone who has been in too close contact with the vanities of the terrestrial universe (to use the phraseology employed by Solomon in Kohelet again and again) automatically will confer some of the pollution represented by these vanities to sacred things he comes into contact with. He will therefore taint the צלם אלוקים, the Divine image in which he has been created. As a result, he must repair, remove such a taint in order to regain his former stature as an אדם. <br> Contact with the dead, results in an awareness of the transience of the lives of all of us, makes us aware of the negative aspects of our lives in this world; this is bound to leave a mark on our personality, one that may even border on considering life on earth as an exercise in futility, as indicated by Solomon when he speaks of such matters in Kohelet. The “world” Kohelet describes, i.e.תחת השמש, as if it exists only beneath the sun, a material world only, would indeed lead its inhabitants to such conclusions.<br> We who believe in a world מעבר לשמש, beyond that serviced by the sun, fortunately have something better to look forward to if we prepare ourselves for this. [I have added remarks of my own to the words of the author but I am certain that these remarks reflect his message. Ed.]<br> When the Torah speaks of וכל הבא אל האהל, “anyone entering the tent wherein the deceased is kept,” this may be understood allegorically as anyone coming under the influence of the הבלי העולם, the vanities of this terrestrial world, the ultimate uselessness of an existence premised on this being all there is to life. <br>Our chapter, when read as a simile, reminds the reader of what the task of an עם קדוש, a “holy nation” is, that it cannot be combined with the pursuit of merely secularly oriented pursuits, they are literally a “dead alley.” The expression משכן ה\' in verse 13 would be the human body, whereas the expression מקדש ה\' would refer to our soul. The author, following the view that gentile corpses do not confer ritual impurity when merely in the same airspace with a Jew, understands this halachah as reflecting the fact that only the body, the physical raw material is called upon to perform the commandments. <br>Seeing that even being in the same airspace as a dead person confers ritual impurity, it is not difficult to understand that people who engage in sprinkling the waters of the red cow and its ash on a person so contaminated, will in turn be affected by such contact with him, and will themselves absorb a degree of impurity, though much less severe, one that can be cleansed by immersion on a ritual bath the same evening. <br> People engaged in indirect procedures preparing the מי נדה will not become ritually impure as they were not in contact with the party to be purified at all. We see that there are many aspects of this commandment which yield valuable lessons for us the readers even if we do not penetrate to the innermost meaning of the legislation.']"
Numbers, 20,3,"[""וירב העם עם משה, the subject of the quarrel was why Moses had brought the people to such a desert as the one they found themselves in at the time. However, there was also a complaint against G’d Himself, as the Torah testifies in verse 13 where the Torah writes: אשר רבו בני ישראל את ה', “in that the Children of Israel quarreled with G’d.” This referred to the words (verse 5) “why did you take us out of Egypt?”\n""]"
Numbers, 20,8,"['קח את המטה...ודברתם אל הסלע, there are numerous opinions of what precisely Moses’ sin consisted of. Many commentators have difficulty understanding the wordsלא האמנתם, ‘you lacked faith” in verse 12 as well as with the word מעלתם בי, “you trespassed against Me” in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.51"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:51"">Deuteronomy 32,51</a>, as well as the words מריתם את פי “you rebelled against My command” in verse 24 of our chapter here. <br>If it had indeed been G’d’s intention that they were only to speak to the rock, what purpose was served in commanding Moses to take the staff? If the sin consisted in that Moses struck the rock, something he had not been commanded to do, what was Aaron’s sin?<br> However, when we scrutinise the matter (the quarrel) more thoroughly we must remember that G’d’s instructions were designed to bring home to the people how wrong they had been in their rebellious attitude. They were meant not only to become aware of this, but to repent it and to apologise for it, seeing that G’d does not desire the death of the sinner but his rehabilitation by his own efforts. <br>Knowing that this is so, Moses and Aaron’s actions or inaction resulted in G’d’s intention of bringing about the people’s repentance of their conduct was thwarted. G’d punished them for having become the instrument of thwarting His plan. <br>The quarrel of the people with Moses was that they accused him of a failure of leadership that resulted in their finding themselves in a situation where they even lacked water for survival. Their quarrel with G’d consisted in their accusing Him of taking them out of a good land called Egypt and bringing them to a desert instead. G’d had wanted to make it clear to them by means of the miracle that Moses had not acted on their own but had merely been His messenger, had carried out his mission faithfully, and that the One Who had sent him had not caused the people any harm at all. We must remember that there are three distinct kinds of miracles in Scripture<br> 1) The “hidden” miracle such as that rain occurs when needed, or that people are recovering from a variety of life threatening diseases. These are the types of miracles that the righteous can bring about by means of their prayers. The Torah quotes an example of this kind of miracle in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.20.17"" data-ref=""Genesis 20:17"">Genesis 20,17</a> when it tells us that Avraham’s prayer resulted in G’d healing the households in Avimelech’s kingdom where an outbreak of a disease had resulted in none of the expectant women being able to give birth to their babies until after Avraham’s prayer. A similar miracle occurred in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.21.7"" data-ref=""Numbers 21:7"">Numbers 21,7</a> when Moses prayed on behalf of the people who had acknowledged that they had sinned.<br> 2)\tThe second type of miracle is an “open” miracle, something that could not be produced by nature without a special assist by G’d, although it could conceivably be become a natural phenomenon over a long period of time. Examples of this kind of miracle are Moses throwing his staff to the earth and G’d turning it into a snake (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.4.5"" data-ref=""Exodus 4:5"">Exodus 4,5</a>) or G’d commanding Moses to raise his staff (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.14.16"" data-ref=""Exodus 14:16"">Exodus 14,16</a>)  and the waters of the sea parting, or Moses striking the rock in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.17.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 17:6"">Exodus 17,6</a> in order to produce water from that rock. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Kings.13.17"" data-ref=""II Kings 13:17"">Kings II 13,17</a> is a similar miracle where Elisha by letting the king shoot arrows means to assure victory over the armies opposing Israel.<br> 3)\tThe third type of miracle is something that nature could never produce however long it practiced. It is a miracle to accomplish which only words are employed. G’d, by means of His prophet, produces a result by means of mere words which demonstrates that use of intelligence without any physical action can produce phenomenal results. This kind of miracle within a material universe employs an absolute minimum of the tools that are the basic instruments of running this terrestrial universe. This is the type of miracle employed when the earth opened and swallowed Korach, etc. (16,31) or when at Joshua’s command the orbit of both the sun and the moon were arrested (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.10.12"" data-ref=""Joshua 10:12"">Joshua 10,12</a>).<br> In our situation G’d was about to provide the Jewish people with the demonstration of such a miracle in order to bring about their repentance when the people would become alert to the uniqueness of the prophet as well as to that of the One Who had made him His emissary, and Moses and Aaron deprived Him of that opportunity by preempting Him through hitting the rock. When G’d said to Moses that the rock ונתן מימיו, “it will give forth its waters,” He meant that it would dissolve into water so that no one could claim that the source of its waters had been elsewhere and that the course of these waters had merely been diverted to make it look as if the stone had turned into water. Moses’ high-handed action in merely striking the rock had been responsible for the fact that this type of miracle had not occurred, and that the aggrandizement of G’d’s name by the performance of such a miracle had not taken place. He himself had testified to this when he said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.8.15"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 8:15"">Deuteronomy 8,15</a> that G’d is One Who המוציא לך מים מצור החלמיש, “Who has produced water for you from the rock which is as hard as flint.” The reason that he chose this adjective is clear. If the waters that gushed forth from that rock had merely been diverted from somewhere else, what difference would it have made if the rock were soft or hard as flint? <br> This type of miracle could never be produced by forces concealed within nature irrespective of thousands and millions of years of evolution. [my choice of word, but author’s meaning. Ed.] G’d had commanded that this type of miracle occur as a result of words spoken by His servants. This is the reason for the emphasis on the words ודברתם אל הסלע, “you are to speak to the rock.” The Children of Israel were to be alerted not just to a miracle, but to the specific nature of this kind of miracle. Observing Moses in action in this fashion, they would get an inkling of the Power of the G’d Who had employed him as His emissary.<br> They were to reflect on the fact that although G’d/Moses had taken the people out of Egypt they had not suffered any harm from that at all seeing that their G’d had been with them every step of the way. He had converted the desert into a pool of water on their behalf, had performed miracles totally beyond the latent powers of nature ever to perform. As long as G’d was with them, i.e. in the words of <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sukkah.53"" data-ref=""Sukkah 53"">Sukkah 53</a>,אם אני כאן הכל כאן, “if I, the Lord, is present, everything you need is present.” <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.2.31"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 2:31"">Jeremiah 2,31</a> phrased it thus: המדבר הייתי לישראל, “was I G’d then a desert for Israel?” (did I not provide everything that is otherwise lacking in a desert?)<br> G’d commanded that as soon as the rock would yield up its water, Moses was to use his staff in order to guide separate streams of that water to the various areas in which each tribe had its tents, so that they would not have to leave their homes, as they did to collect the manna, in order to benefit from this vital resource.<br> This was the meaning of the words “take the staff…..and extract the water for them from the rock and provide water for the congregation” (verse 8). This is also the meaning of 21,18 במחוקק במשענותם, “when they split it with their staff.” Moses and Aaron had agreed between them to carry out the second part of the miracle by bringing water to the people via the rock as they had done at Refidim when the Torah had described what would happen as “when you strike the rock the water will come forth from the rock an the people will drink.” (צור, not סלע), (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.17.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 17:6"">Exodus 17,6</a>) <br> The type of miracle we had described as category three earlier is described here with the words והוצאת להם מים מן הסלע, what Moses and Aaron agreed to do was the lesser level of miracle as they were not sure G’d meant to perform the third category of miracle, i.e. not involving any action such as striking the rock. The reason why they doubted that G’d was going to perform the latter miracle was that they did not considered the Israelites worthy at the time to experience this kind of miracle seeing they had acted in a rebellious manner, Moses himself having addressed them as ממרים, rebels. By performing the second category of miracle, the one which demonstrates only the elevated stature of the messenger, while failing to perform the third category of miracle which would also have demonstrated the exalted nature of the One Who had instructed them as His emissary they committed a serious error. This is the reason the Torah writes לא האמנתם, “you did not have faith enough” (verse 12). The meaning is not that they considered G’d incapable of producing water from the rock by their merely speaking to it, but they did not believe that the circumstances at the time warranted that G’d would put Himself out to such an extent for these people. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.32.51"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 32:51"">Deuteronomy 32,51</a> makes clear that their sin of omission constituted a desecration of G’d’s honour.']"

It is precisely these four garments which he would wear any time he had occasion to enter the Holy of Holies, so that he in no way was deprived of status by not wearing the garments which were meant only for his image among his peers, not for his image when facing G’d.

Examples of such miracles were what happened here and how these waters described a turn returning to their origin, i.e. the well that originated at Massah and Merivah. The reason why the Torah is so vague about these miracles is out of consideration for Moses and Aaron. The reason for these miracles was only in order to demonstrate to the Israelites what kind of miracles they had not been shown because Moses and Aaron had decided not to speak to the rock at the time. The people only found out in retrospect that the waters which had come forth from that rock were not natural waters, subject to the laws of nature such as the laws of gravity. These waters also did not behave according to the laws of centrifugality, i.e. of instead displaying a tendency of flowing towards the center.

The very name יעקב also contains such a dual meaning. On the one hand it appears to have a negative connotation, but it also symbolises עקב a heel, something at the tail end of matters, meaning after everything else has already disappeared the עקב still remains, endures. The name “Israel” that was added to Yaakov’s name was justified by this thought, that its bearer had come out of a confrontation with celestial forces and had survived, had endured.

A tribe who numbered many souls received a quantitatively larger piece of real estate as is spelled out here by the words  לרב תרבו נחלתו, “you shall give a larger inheritance to the numerically superior tribe.”<br>This is the reason why Menashe and Ephrayim received 2 separate territories seeing that their father Joseph had been a firstborn and treated as such in Yaakov’s final blessing, they were entitled to two such shares. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.48.22"" data-ref=""Genesis 48:22"">Genesis 48,22</a>) This is also the way we must understand <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Chronicles.5.1"" data-ref=""I Chronicles 5:1"">Chronicles I 5,1</a> ובחללו יצועי אביו ניתנה בכורתו ליוסף בן ישראל, “and when he defiled the bed of his father his birthright was given to Joseph, son of Yisrael.”<br> Shimon, who numbered fewer people than any other tribe at this count, received a relatively small parcel of land, which itself was an enclave within the territory allocated to the tribe of Yehudah. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.19.9"" data-ref=""Joshua 19:9"">Joshua 19,9</a> on this subject) This also was the fulfillment of Yaakov’s wish in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.49.7"" data-ref=""Genesis 49:7"">Genesis 49,7</a> “I will divide both Levi and Shimon among the tribes of Israel.”\n']"

Numbers, 28,11,"['ובראשי חדשיכם, it was an ancient custom among the Israelites to treat the day of the new moon as a semi festival. We know this already from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.20.19"" data-ref=""I Samuel 20:19"">Samuel I 20,19</a> where Yonathan  describes the day as one on which no work is performed in the field, a day not defined as יום המעשה, “a working day.” This is why this day has retained a special significance for the Jewish people, i.e. the Torah describes it as ראשי חדשיכם “the beginning of your months.” You will not find the regular festivals, מועדים described as “your festivals.” We do not find the Sabbath described as “your Sabbath” or the festival of Shavuot as “your day of the firstling fruits.” [the author will go to some length to explain that the ending כם in the word שבועותיכם in verse 26 does not refer to that festival. Ed.] Neither do we find the expression סכותיכם, etc.<br> The reason for this ancient custom of treating the day of the new moon almost like a festival is that historically, success of the Jewish people in matters terrestrial has always been linked to the lunar cycle. The moon is a phenomenon which has no light of its own, a phenomenon which depends on receiving and reflecting light from an external source.<br> Although prior to the sin of the golden calf the Jewish people’s fate was totally independent of any foreign domination, described as חרות על הלוחות, a kind of absolute independence, freedom engraved on the Tablets (the first set no doubt), (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.16"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:16"">Exodus 32,16</a>) as well as Eyruvin 54 and Tanchuma, Ki Tissa 16), once they had sinned they (divested themselves of this privilege, (and) no longer made use of this “Royal crown” at all times as did the other nations, so that they did no longer appear to enjoy this advantage over the other nations of the world. <br>Ever since that spiritual disaster, the Jewish people could enjoy their original privilege of independence from the restrictions imposed by the fact that one is part of the “laws of nature” only on rare occasions in their history, whereas most of the time they were dependent on “light”, i.e. good fortune, from external sources not under their control. To that extent, their history reflects the situation of the moon with its periods of ascent and decline month after month. When the moon is not directly exposed to the light of the sun it becomes invisible. The expression אין מזל לישראל, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.126"" data-ref=""Shabbat 126"">Shabbat 126</a>) means that the Jewish people do not generate light of their own, do not work at being masters of their own fate, but rely entirely on G’d to guide their fates. They receive this Divinely emanated light when their deeds are pleasing to G’d. <br>This is why in the parlance of our prophets G’d Himself is referred to as: “אור ישראל” Israel’s source of light. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.10.16"" data-ref=""Isaiah 10:16"">Isaiah 10,16</a> as well as <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.27.1"" data-ref=""Psalms 27:1"">Psalms 27,1</a> where David refers to G’d. as אורי וישעי, “my light and my salvation.”)<br> Whenever the Jewish people are in a state of sin, their sins act as a barrier between them and their G’d so that they are deprived of their source of light. When Isaiah describes their state of being when sinful, he speaks of their G’d’s hiding His face from them, as Israel walking in darkness harassed by the gentile nations. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.59.2"" data-ref=""Isaiah 59:2"">Isaiah 59,2</a>).<br> Whenever the Jewish people’s fortunes are at low ebb this represents a desecration of G’d’s name, i.e. His reputation, as the gentiles refer to us sneeringly as עם ה\' אלה “are these the ones who describe themselves as G’d’s special nation?” We can understand what our sages have said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Gittin.58"" data-ref=""Gittin 58"">Gittin 58</a> that whenever the Jewish people are in trouble, G’d is automatically forced to share their troubles. Having linked His honour to the honour and glory of the Jewish people, He suffers with us, (allegorically speaking). Whenever we suffer, whenever we are in a state of being oppressed, G’d is described as saying that “the pirate has attacked Me and you simultaneously.”<br> Seeing that the sin offering presented on New Moon’s day is an atonement for the Jewish people who are the cause of preventing the light of the moon to shine, or the reason it shines so weakly when it does shine, the sages in our prayers on that day referred to that sin offering as לכפר בעדם זכרון לכולם יהיו תשועת נפשם מיד שונא, “to obtain atonement for themselves. They were to be a memorial for them all, and a salvation for their soul from the hand of the enemy.” This is the reason that this is the only sin offering described as חטאת לה\', “a sin offering on behalf of G’d.” Presentation of  this offering is also in respect of the damage the sinful behaviour of the Jewish people has inflicted on G’d’s image among the gentile nations. <br> When we read about the dialogue described between the moon and G’d in Chulin 60, where G’d is eventually described as saying to the Jewish people “bring a sin offering on My behalf,” (in expiation for My diminishing the light of the moon) what the sage (Rabbi Shimon ben Pezzi) wanted to explain by putting such strange sounding words in G’d’s mouth is that ultimately the reason why the moon was diminished was because seeing it has a kinship with the Jewish people and these did not always live up to their lofty destiny, the moon [as a celestial representative of G’d Himself, Ed.] therefore has to suffer alongside with them for their shortcomings. Seeing this may not sound quite fair, G’d allegorically ordered a sin offering to be brought by the Jewish people on New Moon’s day in order appease the moon.\n']"

A woman who is married and therefore subject to restrictions imposed upon her by the authority of her husband, is not considered as having desecrated G’d’s name when violating her vows or oath on that account, provided her husband had declared her vow void.']"

When the killing occurred only a short time before the death of the High Priest, the exile spends little time in the city of refuge; on the other hand, there may be times when the exile dies in the city of refuge before the High Priest officiating at the time of the “crime,” dies. These variables are taken into account by G’d Who alone is in possession of all the facts, i.e. the degree of negligence which caused this inadvertent killing.

Each time they arrived at a spot where they made camp Moses reminded them that the reason that they had still not reached their final destination was due to their having committed so many sins. The proof was that  אחד עשר יום יש מחורב עד קדש ברנע...דרך הר שעיר, the shortest route to Kadesh Barnea, the southern boundary of the Land of Israel is only 11 days’ march away from Mount Chorev when traveling via Mount Seir. In fact, G’d made them reach Kadesh Barnea after they set out from Chorev in only three days by leading them through the great and terrible desert.

He did this by starting with a reminder of the covenant concluded between Israel and G’d at Mount Chorev. (compare 5,2) לאמר, before beginning with reviewing portions of the Torah, Moses explained the reason for the need to do this as being that they were about to cross into what would become their homeland where many commandments of the Torah would apply for the first time. Seeing that he could not do this at the time when they actually applied already, he had to do this now before his death.

Rather than focusing on their major problem, how to get out of the desert into the promised land, they had wasted their time and efforts in the pursuit of petty concerns, undermining their inter-personal relationships in the process. Due to this interminable quarreling, Moses had been forced to appoint a large number of judges that had to exert authority over the individuals down to every 10 people requiring at least one such judge. This could only have been due to some character weakness, some pre-disposition to be quarrelsome.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 1,19,"['ונלך את כל המדבר הגדול והנורא, a way no one had crossed on foot before because of the many snakes and other predators and their size. These are referred to once more in 8,15. Our sages in Sifri 18 have described that the snakes were as large as beams and the scorpions as bows. If G’d had nonetheless chosen to lead them on this route, it had been to shorten the distance they would have to travel so that they could get to their destination before their tendency to quarrel, etc., would result in major sins. Nonetheless, G’d’s efforts in this respect had not proven to be sufficient; they had sinned on numerous occasions at locations Moses recalls by name.']"
Deuteronomy, 1,21,"[' עלה רש, for no one will oppose you.']"
Deuteronomy, 1,22,"['ותקרבון אלי כלכם, even though you had leaders appointed to act as your representatives, appointed to concern themselves with your communal concerns, you all ganged up on me.', 'נשלחה אנשים, “we ourselves want to appoint these men and dispatch them.” This was something G’d did not approve of, and this is why He told Moses: “you dispatch them!” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.13.2"" data-ref=""Numbers 13:2"">Numbers 13,2</a>) The men that were to spy out the land were to be appointed by Moses himself, not by a mob. G’d was afraid that the people would appoint totally unsuitable people to be their spies. The Torah had therefore made a point of reporting that the men selected for this task by Moses were all known as outstanding people, כלם אנשים, including such men as Joshua and Calev. Even those among them, who in the end  expressed their belief that they could not hope to conquer this land, did not have the effrontery to badmouth the land itself, but praised it as an excellent land. This was also why it was possible for the people to repent their sin, i.e. they had made a faulty judgment in believing the 10 spies’ assessment of the chances of conquering the land. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.13.41-45"" data-ref=""Numbers 13:41-45"">Numbers 13, 41-45</a>.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 1,23,"['וייטב בעיני הדבר, I thought that none of you would not believe G’d when He had said that He would bring you to that country and that it was a good land and that you would be able with His help to conquer it. I believed that the thought behind your desire to send out spies was not that you wanted to see if you could conquer it, but that you wanted to select for yourselves the best sections of the land, and that this was what you had in mind when you said  (verse 22) “the cities which we will come to.” This seemed totally reasonable, since you were aware that the conquest would not be immediately of the whole country, seeing G’d had told us this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.29"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:29"">Exodus 23,29</a>.']"

Deuteronomy, 1,26,"['ולא אביתם לעלות, for at that point you revealed your original sinful approach, i.e. that your motivation had not been to select the best part of the country for yourselves at this time, as I had thought, based on what you had said. Your purpose in the mission had been to determine if it was possible to conquer this land, something that revealed that you did not believe G’d’s promise to you. As a result of your lack of belief you accepted what the spies told you when they said that these people are too strong, and you refused to ascend to this land. \n']"
Deuteronomy, 1,27,"[""בשנאת ה' אותנו, because we had worshipped idols while we were in Egypt."", 'He has now decided to deliver us into the hands of the Emorite even though He is perfectly capable to conquer the Emorites and to kill them, He will take revenge on us by delivering us into their hands.']"
Deuteronomy, 1,31,"[""אשר נשאך ה' אלוקיך, in this great and terrible desert. If G’d had wanted to take His revenge on you, all He had to do was to leave you to the mercy of these predators.""]"

Deuteronomy, 1,34,"['את קול דבריכם, your uncalled for weeping.']"
Deuteronomy, 1,37,"['גם בי התאנף ה\' בגללכם, this was in order that you would have reason to cry throughout the ages, as G’d had decreed in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.14.28"" data-ref=""Numbers 14:28"">Numbers 14,28</a>. When that verse referred to דבריכם, “your words,” the objectionable words G’d had referred to were: “our children and wives will become loot,” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.14.5"" data-ref=""Numbers 14:5"">Numbers 14,5</a>). Moses told the people at this stage the real reason for his impending death, even though the cause occurred already 38 years earlier. At that time G’d had announced His decree אם יראה איש באנשים האלה, adding that by contrastוטפכם אשר אמרתם לבז יהי, “your children concerning whom you had predicted that they would wind up as loot, as prisoners of war, would conquer the land.” The major point Moses is making, [and I am paraphrasing the author who quotes <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.106.26-27"" data-ref=""Psalms 106:26-27"">Psalms 106,26-27</a>, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.20.23"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 20:23"">Ezekiel 20,23</a>, as well as <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.106.32-40"" data-ref=""Psalms 106:32-40"">Psalms 106,32-40</a>, Ed] is that were it not for the fact that he also had not been allowed to enter the Holy Land, they would have been condemned to extinction. The fact that he, the innocent leader, had been included in their punishment was for the sake of the nation’s survival as such, even if traumatic exile experiences lay ahead of them.  (compare our author on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.4.1"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 4:1"">Deut. 4,1</a>)\n']"
Deuteronomy, 1,45,"['ולא שמע ה\' בקולכם, on account of the desecration of His name that was part of their sin. Whenever a sin includes חילול השם, the desecration of G’d’s name, (seeing that is by definition something public) forgiveness without death of the penitent sinner is impossible. Not only that, but G’d’s decree had been formulated as an oath, something that made it irrevocable after both Joshua and Calev had made efforts to make the people reconsider their negative attitude by accusing G’d of hating them. As a matter of fact, even when they did repent afterwards, this was not genuine, but was based on their fear of punishment. As a result, such a repentance is not sufficient to cancel the punishment due in this life. Something similar had already occurred with Kayin, who also repented but only because he could not face the punishment in store for him. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.4.15"" data-ref=""Genesis 4:15"">Genesis 4,15</a>) Both King Shaul, in respect of his failure to wipe out Amalek completely, (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.15.26"" data-ref=""I Samuel 15:26"">Samuel I 15,26</a>) and the High Priest Eli (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.3.14"" data-ref=""I Samuel 3:14"">Samuel I 3,14</a>) repented, but did so only out of their unwillingness to face their punishment.', 'ולא האזין אליכם. G’d did not even listen to your plea to delay the punishment, or to suspend the part of the punishment for their children after their parents had died. Moses used this fact as proof that the repentance of their parents at the time had not been complete, sincere. As a result, even their tears had been to no avail.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 2,7,"['ידע לכתך, He repaired or improved that way wherever necessary. The word ידע is used here in the same sense as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.5.25"" data-ref=""Exodus 5:25"">Exodus 5,25</a> וידע אלוקים, where it meant that G’d took benevolent notice of the plight the Israelites were in and began to rectify their situation. Similar uses of the term are found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.12"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:12"">Exodus 33,12</a> where Moses is the beneficiary of such ידיע, and in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.34.10"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 34:10"">Deuteronomy 34,10</a> where he is again described as the beneficiary of such a ידיע, intimate familiarity with G’d.']"
Deuteronomy, 2,10,"['האימים לפנים, seeing that the descendants of Lot had no legal claim to inherit anything from Avraham at all, G’d announced that He had given them ancestral land just as He had done to the descendants of Esau who were descended from Avraham in a straight line. G’d testifies that both the Ammonites and the Moabites came to possess what they owned contrary to accepted norms.']"
Deuteronomy, 2,12,"['וישמידום. Esau and Moav destroyed more land and people than they needed for themselves. They did so in order to wipe out all the former people residing there so that they could not one day avenge their defeat. This was a totally unjustifiable genocide. Neither Esau nor Moav populated all the land under their control The area known as Har Seir bordered on areas formerly belonging to Moav and was unpopulated by any members of the tribe of Esau. The same was true on the other side of that boundary; it was not populated by any Moabites. This is why Moses is speaking of G’d having told him that although this was in effect “no-man’s land,” the Israelites were not even to traverse this region, as, nominally, it belonged to either the descendants of Lot or those of Esau.', 'כאשר עשה ישראל, a reference to the time when the Torah was committed to writing when the lands of Sichon and Og had already been captured. Those two kings had been most powerful; nonetheless, they had been vanquished within a very short space of time, contrary to accepted norms. This all showed that G’d had given these lands to the Israelites.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 2,13,"['עתה קומו, seeing that it is forbidden to you to cross territory belonging to either the Moabites or the Edomites, קומו ועברו לכם את נחל זרד, which is outside the territory of either one of these nations. From that point you will be able to advance as far as the Jordan.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 2,20,"['ארץ רפאים תחשב אף היא, there can be no question that the Ammonites had no legal right to dispossess these people; the only reason why they succeeded in doing so was because it was G’d’s will.']"
Deuteronomy, 2,22,"['כאשר עשה לבני עשו, just as G’d had done for the descendants of Esau who, after settling in the land of Seir, had driven out the inhabitants  (the Chori) from there.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 2,23,"['והעוים היושבים בחצרים עד עזה, even though the latter belonged to the descendants of Esau or the Philistines with whom Avraham had made a solemn non aggression pact, the Israelites were not now denied the right to conquer these lands. The reason they could do so now was that the Philistines no longer owned the land in question כפתורים היוצאימ מכפתור, the Cretans emigrating from Crete because their island could not contain them all and who were seeking “lebensraum,” had annihilated the Avim and replaced them in that land. When the Israelites conquered the land in which Avimelech used to be king, it already had been lost by Avimelech. [Perhaps the reason that this coastal strip was still known as “the land of the Philistines,” long after the Israelites drove out the Canaanites, is the same as when the Torah referred to the land of the descendants of Ammon as “the land of the Refaim,” (verse 20) the latter having been its original owners.” Ed.]\n']"
Deuteronomy, 2,30,"[""כי הקשה ה' אלוקיך את רוחו, in order for him to refuse to allow the Israelites to traverse his territory."", 'ואמץ את לבבו, in order to make war against them.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 3,10,"['ערי ממלכת עוג בבשן....כי רק עוג מלך הבשן נשאר, the reason why he ruled in that district was because he was the only one remaining from the Refaim of old. Ever since the war between Amrafel and his allies who defeated the Refaim on their way to Sodom at Ashterot Karnayim (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.14.5"" data-ref=""Genesis 14:5"">Genesis 14,5</a>), there were numerous individual Refaim remaining. These defeated the Ammonites as mentioned in 2,21. During that war against the Ammonites only Og survived. Seeing that he was a famous hero, equaling the combined power of all the other Refaim, he was the one who ruled.']"
Deuteronomy, 3,11,"['באמת איש; according what the Refaim had adopted as their standard cubit, i.e. a much longer one than that of average sized citizens. Such subjective, as opposed to standard. measurements, are mentioned in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.56.11"" data-ref=""Isaiah 56:11"">Isaiah 56,11</a> where the prophet speaks of איש לבצעו מקצהו, “every one has done his own thing.” The word איש also occurs describing such individual feats in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Kings.20.20"" data-ref=""I Kings 20:20"">Kings I 20,20</a> ויכו איש אישו, “each man struck the opponent facing him.” There are other verses in which the word איש does not mean “man,” but is a simile for the individual nature of something, No doubt there were many “cubits” other than the one described here as 9 times the length of the cubit of an average sized individual. The reason the Torah relates this historically hardly important information is to impress the reader with the extraordinary size of these Refaim. The strength of such giants can be imagined once we are aware of their size. The fact that the Ammonites had been able to defeat a nation whose warriors were of such proportions gives us a clear indication that it must have been G’d’s will that they were able to do so. (compare our commentary on 2,21).\n']"
Deuteronomy, 3,24,"['ואת ידך החזקה, demonstrated by overriding well known laws of nature. No one but the Creator of the universe is able to do this. Moses credits G’d with having done all this only in order to be able to bring the Jewish people to the Holy Land. In view of the length to which G’d had gone to do this it behooves the people to do everything in order to justify their remaining in that land.']"
Deuteronomy, 3,25,"['אעברה נא, in order to exterminate all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan in order that the Jewish people will never be exiled from that land.

Deuteronomy, 3,26,"[""ויתעבר ה' בי למענכם, G’d was angry at me for trying to ensure your permanent stay in that land while He had already decreed that at a certain point in history your descendants would be exiled among the gentiles. ""]"
Deuteronomy, 4,1,"['ועתה ישראל, after you have seen the decree of G’d to exile you if you sin, be on guard to meticulously observe His commandments without adding to them or detracting from them. An addition or a detraction will both have destructive consequences for you.']"
Deuteronomy, 4,2,"['ולא תגרעו ממנו לשמור, a person should not make the mistake made by King Solomon that he can ignore a prohibition since he knows the reason for the prohibition and can create conditions when such a prohibition would not be justified.

Solomon relied on his wisdom not to lead him astray and ignored the Torah’s law with disastrous consequences for his kingdom. Ed.]']"
Deuteronomy, 4,3,"['עיניכם הרואות, Moses reminds the people that they had observed the truth of this with their own eyes when their brethren, in their lust, not meaning to commit idolatry, had nevertheless done so, as they had been overcome by their libidos at the time so that they succumbed to seduction. The Torah testifies that their original sin had “only” been to whore with the daughters of Moav. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.25.1"" data-ref=""Numbers 25:1"">Numbers 25,1</a>) The Torah, in outlawing sexual relations with non Jews had added that if this law was ignored the result would be intermarriage, idol worship by the children of such a marriage, etc. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.16"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:16"">Exodus 34,16</a>) Every Israelite who indulged his lust for a Moabite girl had considered himself immune to such a warning.

They had been tricked into it without realising it.']"

Deuteronomy, 4,7,"['כי מי גוי גדול אשר אלוקים קרובים אליו, for it will pay you to be considered intelligent and wise in the eyes of the gentiles seeing that G’d is close to us בכל קראנו אליו, whenever we call upon Him. This teaches the gentiles that we are the chosen people. If the gentiles would consider you as being fools this would be a desecration of G’d’s name for they would then ask derisively: “is this the nation that claims to be G’d’s special nation?” (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.36.20"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 36:20"">Ezekiel 36,20</a>)\n']"
Deuteronomy, 4,8,"['ומי גוי גדול אשר לו חקים ומשפטים צדיקים, the reason that you will be considered as so wise in the eyes of the gentile nations is because you observe the commandments and statutes of G’d. There is no other nation in existence that can boast such a set of laws which by themselves point the way to G’d’s existence and His wonderful ways. Who else has social laws which have neither been designed for the benefit of the judges nor for the benefit their bureaucracy and their clerks, but serve one interest only the dispensation of justice and fairness? Our sages phrased it thus: “what is justice for one is at the same time fairness, righteousness for the opposing party.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sanhedrin.6"" data-ref=""Sanhedrin 6"">Sanhedrin 6</a>). Restitution of stolen property to the victim is justice, having returned stolen property makes the erstwhile thief once more a צדיק, a righteous person. ']"
Deuteronomy, 4,9,"['רק השמר לך, even though I have said that you are wise people in the eyes of the gentile nations, be careful not to absorb the views of the wise men of those nations who deny the existence of G’d the Creator and His ability and His supervision of the universe He has created. They may try to convince you with all kinds of intelligent sounding theories.', 'פן תשכח את הדברים אשר ראו עיניך, The reason why G’d has cautioned you to be so much on your guard is that you might forget the evidence of your own eyes, at Mount Sinai, as well as in Egypt and at the Sea of Reeds, and as a result be misled by your mental eyes when interpreting the Torah. This was the purpose of miracles which challenged your intellect, to show you that commonly held concepts are not necessarily true. [perhaps the author has in mind the first such miracle Moses experienced when he observed with his physical eyes that the burning bush did not burn up and turn into ashes. The Israelites, when observing the spectacle of fire within the ice of the hail, the seventh plague, collectively experienced another challenge to the concept that fire and water are totally incompatible with one another.

Deuteronomy, 4,16,"['תמונת כל סמל, something that would reflect the belief of those who hold that every perishable, ephemeral phenomenon in this world has a counterpart in the celestial regions which it is derived from, and that people made themselves replicas of what they thought the original looked like.']"
Deuteronomy, 4,19,"[""חלק ה' אלוקיך אותם לכל העמים, He arranged for them to appear in a manner appropriate for the needs of each respective nation, according to their individual differences.

Deuteronomy, 4,24,"['אש אוכלה הוא, a fire which consumes other fire, thereby destroying the soul together with the body.', 'א-ל קנא, [I am paraphrasing the author here. Ed.] Jealousy is based on someone observing that something contractually exclusively his, as for instance the, fidelity of his wife- is being offered or provided for someone else. If a master’s servant provides the services he is supposed to provide only for his master to others, this arouses the master’s jealousy. If a Jew in any shape or form makes available to idolatrous cults the services he is supposed to perform for G’d, he arouses G’d’s jealousy.\n']"

When the members of the host countries make such sculptures they mean to draw attention to the force in the universe which is responsible for such phenomena in our day and age. [in the author’s time, art, generally, was legitimate only if it claimed to represent matters compatible with the dogmas of the Church, for instance. Ed.] The members of the host countries labour under the mistaken belief that the “originators” of the phenomena they worship produced what they produced out of their own volition; they do not realise that these “originators” had been programmed to do this by G’d the Creator.

Deuteronomy, 5,14,"['למעו ינוח עבדך ואמתך כמוך, from the positioning of the commandment that your beasts of burden have to refrain from performing work for you on the Sabbath, before mentioning your children and servants observing such Sabbath rest, it is clear that the reasons animals owned by you must rest o the Sabbath is for the sake of the men working them, not because animals per se are subject to the spiritual concepts governing the Sabbath and its laws. The need for one’s slaves to observe the Sabbath rest is, of course, part of the reminder that when you were slaves you did not enjoy such a day of rest. Hence, do not treat your slave in the hateful you were treated when you were in his shoes.']"

He alone is fit to have prayers addressed to.', ""ה' אחד; seeing that He created all phenomena in this universe, celestial or terrestrial out of a total void, it is logically impossible for there to be another phenomenon representing an existence independent of Him. It also makes him basically different, unique, for all things created by Him are by definition potentially terminal, transient existences.  He is absolutely unique in the world based on four basic raw materials, water, fire, earth, air. This idea appears to be hinted at in the letter ד=4 in the word אחד which is written larger than usual and the letter ע in the word שמע which is also written in larger than normal script, suggesting that we should use our eyes to take note of these concepts, the “testimony, עד” that this is so.

Ed.] can be understood on two levels: 1) the “good” the wicked appear to enjoy in this life is due to merits accumulated by their forefathers who had not been recompensed for these as yet by G’d. A prominent example of this is the enjoyable life lived by Ishmael who benefited by Avraham’s merits. G’d Himself referred to this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.21.13"" data-ref=""Genesis 21:13"">Genesis 21,13</a> when He said כי זרעך הוא, “because he is your seed. 2) The wicked person himself has accumulated some merits; seeing that on balance he does not qualify for life in the hereafter, G’d has to compensate him while he is on earth.

Deuteronomy, 7,12,"['והיה עקב תשמעון, Moses explains that the reason why the King, i.e. G’d, commands them to observe all these commandments is in order to be able to fulfill the promises made to their forefathers regarding them. The people were meant to observe these commandments out of a feeling of love for G’d, not because they did so in order to earn a reward. [If I understand the author correctly, the wordsואת החסד in the phrase את הברית והחסד, are to establish reciprocity of G’d’s loving care for the patriarchs, the parties to the covenant, and their descendants’ feeling of love on their part towards the Creator.

Besides, anything which is done by G’d personally, without His having recourse to an intermediary, is something that endures forever. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ecclesiastes.3.14"" data-ref=""Ecclesiastes 3:14"">Kohelet 3,14</a> כי כל אשר יעשה האלוקים הוא אשר יהיה לעולם,”anything which G’d does Himself is something that will endure forever.” By contrast, transient phenomena, [such as extinct species, for instance, Ed.] are proof of the fact that they were the products of intermediaries of G’d. [G’d had commanded the waters to produce the living creatures of the waters, and He had commanded the earth to produce vegetation and the mammals, etc. Water and the earth are both intermediaries.

(based on the statement in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.39"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 39"">Kidushin 39</a> that reward, in the sense of compensation, for commandments performed is not something that is due while we are on earth.)\n']"

Deuteronomy, 14,3,"['לא תאכל כל תועבה; before the Torah had been revealed, given, the Israelites as well as mankind generally were aware of the concepts “pure, טהור,” and “טמא, impure.” This is clear already from G’d’s command to Noach to take into the ark with him one pair each of the “impure” species,” and seven pairs each of the “pure” species of animals and birds. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.7.2"" data-ref=""Genesis 7:2"">Genesis 7,2</a>) When G’d, after the deluge, permitted man to eat meat, He did not distinguish between meat from “pure” animals and meat from “impure animals.” However, now, after the giving of the Torah, when the Jewish people had become so special, it was no longer appropriate for them to ingest the remains of impure animals or birds (or even fish). Our sustenance should not be dependent on such inferior living beings. We should remain constantly aware of the gulf between man and beast, especially beasts which had never been suitable as sacrifices.\n']"

Deuteronomy, 14,22,"['עשר תעשר, for by tithing the crops of the fields and orchards as well as that of your livestock, you will actually increase their numbers (G’d will see to this) instead of decreasing the amount at your disposal.

The words משה ידו, “what is owed him as a creditor” in our verse make this pretty clear. [Furthermore, if the word מקץ means “at the end,” it is clear that this verse does not refer to the produce grown during that year. Ed.]']"
Deuteronomy, 15,4,"['אפס כי לא יהיה בך אביון, even though I have said that you must forgive overdue debts, the fact is that there will be no need for this commandment to apply in practice as there will not be anyone in that kind of need.

Deuteronomy, 15,19,"['כל הבכור, after the Torah has listed a number of acts of kindness you are to perform with parts of your harvest in the field and orchard, something called the “tithe for the poor,” as well as an equivalent at the end of the sh’mittah year in money, i.e. the waiving of past due debts, acts of charity, and acts of helping your former servant to establish an economic base for himself, Moses now explains in detail commandments which are acts of gratitude vis a vis G’d, i.e. the giving to G’d or His representative the firstborn males of your livestock, i.e. sheep, goats and cattle. It is incumbent upon the owner of such herds to thank the Lord, for it is He Who is the source of his wealth. This is followed by repetition of the commandments to observe Passover, the commemoration of our obtaining political freedom, as well as the annual date on which the early barley harvest is acknowledged with an appropriate offering, and of Shavuot, the obtaining of our spiritual freedom when we received the Torah in capsule form, i.e. the Ten Commandments. Shavuot also ranks as the primary harvest festival celebrating the cutting of the wheat harvest.<br> Finally, we observe the Sukkot festival signaling that the last of the various harvests, particularly that of the trees has been successfully brought into the barns. On each of these festivals the farmer brings a gift for G’d with him when he makes the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the Temple. This is spelled out in 16,16. Seeing that the occasion for this is one or all of these three festivals, there is no need for the Torah to mention a specific date as we all know the dates of these festivals. The Torah does mention the season during which these festivals occur, to remind us that they are connected with times of significance to each farmer.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 16,1,"['שמור את חודש האביב, make sure that the month of Nissan always occurs in the spring, by manipulating the calendar, if necessary and inserting an extra month of Adar. By doing this the solar orbit (year) and the lunar orbits, (12 moons equaling a year) can be brought into line with each other.', 'ועשית פסח, on the first evening of the festival of matzot', 'כי בחודש האביב הוציאך, because it was G’d’s will that your departure from Egypt should be at the time when the month signaling the beginning of spring should occur, astrologically a time when the zodiac sign of the lamb ascends in tandem with the sun, and is opposite the moon, the latter symbolising the Jewish people, as opposed to the Egyptians who worship the sun as a major deity.', 'לילה, on that occasion, the sun/lamb being opposite the moon occurred at night. Seeing that one cannot offer a sacrifice at night, the Torah arranged for the Passover to be offered on the afternoon preceding that night. As a commemoration of that event, it was decided not to change the time of offering the Passover even though the astrological/astronomical data change from year to year.\n']"

The taskmasters had always been rushing them, during their entire stay in Egypt as slave labourers.', 'כי בחפזון יצאת, the reason why we have to remember this state of haste is because haste is a form of pressure. It was because you always had to rush while being slaves that the redemption when it came also came in the guise of extreme haste. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.31.12"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 31:12"">Jeremiah 31,12</a> describes such an experience in the words והפכתי אבלם לששון, “I will turn their mourning into joy.”', 'למען תזכור את יום צאתך מארץ מצרים כל ימי חייך, the reason why I have commanded to eternalize this manifestation of G’d’s direct guidance of your fate, השגחה, is so that the compensation of the shorter lunar year with the seasonal orbits of the solar year be effected through the addition of extra days or an extra month, so that this month will always occur partially after the equinox of spring. I did not legislate anything similar for the solar year as there is no need for it, and that would have little to do with the Exodus. There is no reason why the gentile nations should commemorate the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt. כל ימי חייך, every time the calendar is adjusted, be it to add a day or to add a month, you will be reminded of the reason for this being a reminder of the Exodus from Egypt.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 16,4,"['ולא יראה לך שאור בכל גבולך שבעת ימים, even though this was not a requirement on the original Passover in Egypt.', 'ולא ילין מן הבשר, so that you should not think that leftovers of the Passover sacrifice were forbidden only on the original occasion, seeing that on that occasion the people were in such a state of haste, that the Torah did not want leftover sacred meat to be at the disposal of the Egyptians.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 16,5,"['לא תוכל לזבוח את הפסח, even though in Egypt there was no need to slaughter the Passover either on an altar or in a Temple (precincts), this is not the way it is to be observed in the future.']"
Deuteronomy, 16,8,"['וביום השביעי עצרת, on that day the Israelites are to be assembled together in communal worship of the Lord.

Deuteronomy, 16,15,"['כי יברכך, so that you will have a great deal of gathering in to do, and as a result, the poor will also find much to collect.', 'והיית אך שמח, you will be completely joyful; no sadness will intrude on your happy frame of mind.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 16,17,"['איש כמתנת ידו, not that he has to give away all that he owns so that as a result he will become a charge on public charity; an interpretation offered by foolish gentiles. Our sages have long ago postulated that even the most generously inclined person should not give away more than one fifth of his wealth. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ketubot.50"" data-ref=""Ketubot 50"">Ketuvot 50</a>)']"
Deuteronomy, 16,18,"['שופטים ושוטרים, after Moses had addressed a number of commandments to the people at large, he now turned to instruct the leaders of the people in commandments of special concern for them. By paying especial attention to observing these laws, the leaders, especially the judges, kings and prophets, would be able to maintain the spiritual level of the people at large, and thus ensure the people’s continued tenure of the Land of Israel. In the words of the prophet: “when the lion roars who does not tremble?” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Amos.3.8"" data-ref=""Amos 3:8"">Amos 3,8</a>) Tzefaniah phrased it somewhat differently, providing degrees of reactions to people in varying degrees of authority. (Tzefaniah 3,3 describes the princes, leading authorities as being feared like roaring lions, whereas the judges who have no executive powers are feared in the manner one is afraid of wolves.)', 'נותן לך לשבטיך, in the gates (cities) He is about to give to you. You are to divide the judges to districts, i.e. each of your cities must have a judiciary. This restriction does not apply to land conquered outside the traditional boundaries of Israel; there, seeing the land was not divided into tribal parcels, the judiciary appointed also did not have to adhere to this pattern. Examples of such regions were Syria, etc.', 'משפט צדק, the manner in which the complaints of the litigants were heard should be such that the resulting decisions could be expected to be fair, צדק, righteous. The judges were not to discriminate in their treatment of either of the opposing litigants.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 16,20,"['צדק צדק תרדוף. When you are about to put this legislation into practice, the party in charge of appointing such judges is told by Moses to select only those who are already known for their sense of fair play and righteousness. He will have to look for such people all over the tribe. If potential judges do not have all the qualifications which are desirable in a judge, this qualification of fairness is the overriding quality all must possess. This is what the prophet Samuel was told by G’d when he had to look for a replacement of King Sha-ul among the sons of Yishai. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.16.7"" data-ref=""I Samuel 16:7"">Samuel I 16,7</a>) He was specifically told to ignore external appearances.', 'למען תחיה וירשת, such qualities are of even greater importance in the Land of Israel, as a failure to comply would result in the ancestral right to that country being denied to you. Compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.57.17"" data-ref=""Isaiah 57:17"">Isaiah 57,17</a> who quotes G’d as telling him that a corrupt judiciary [getting away with sinful greed? Ed.] was a primary cause for G’d’s anger at the people.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 16,21,"['לא תטע לך אשרה, in this verse the Torah lists three items whose common denominator is that they appeal to the senses, are desirable, but at the same time are all spiritually negative, harmful.  <br> The first one is האשרה, something beautiful and decorative for buildings, but at the same time something ugly from the vantage point of holiness as it is usually a conduit leading to idolatrous practices. Seeing that this is so, we are commanded whenever faced with such choices to give preference to that which leads to spiritual righteousness at the expense of physical perfection or beauty. By the same token, we are to prefer spiritual qualities possessed by someone chosen as a judge to external features, impressive though they may be.  <br> The second item is המצבה, even though such a kind of altar was welcomed by G’d as an outlet for someone who wanted to bring an offering to G’d, this was before the Torah had been given. Consider, for example, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.24.4"" data-ref=""Exodus 24:4"">Exodus 24,4</a> where the Torah welcomed 12 such monuments erected by Moses, where these monuments symbolised the fact that the person offering a sacrifice considered himself as constantly in the presence of the divine. (compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.16.8"" data-ref=""Psalms 16:8"">Psalms 16,8</a> שויתי ה\' לנגדי תמיד, “I feel myself constantly in the presence of the Lord.”) The Jewish people had not been able to maintain this spiritual level after they had committed the sin of the golden calf. Even when such a מצבה is dedicated to heaven it had become hateful in the eyes of the Lord, i.e. G’d had expressed His distaste in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.3"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:3"">Exodus 33,3</a>, after having provisionally “forgiven” the people by appointing an angel to lead them to the Holy Land, but refusing to lead their ascent by His presence being among them. We encounter a similar concept described as the difference between an old man whose beard proclaims his respectability, as opposed to the old man whose beard is disheveled, i.e. reveals traces of a youth which was spent irresponsibly.  We look for people whose exterior testifies to their blameless interior, character. [This metaphor is used by the Chazzan in his private introductory prayer on Yom Hakippurim. Ed.] <br> The third item, also reminding us of the rejection of an externally basically beautiful animal as a sacrifice, is a series of blemishes, some quite minor, not affecting the value of the animal in question in the market place at all. Such a blemish in an animal worth 1000 dollars disqualifies it as an offering, whereas another similar animal worth one single dollar, but without such a blemish, is given preference over the far more expensive animal, which is rejected. The Torah gives us three examples to teach us basically the same lesson. What is true of the blemished animal for presentation on the altar, is equally true for the venerable old scholar who is afflicted with some character fault.  We are to look further in order to find a less impressive individual not afflicted with such character fault.']"
Deuteronomy, 17,2,"['כי ימצא בקרבך, after Moses instructed the people to appoint judges in each city so that each court would judge primarily people who lived in its vicinity, Moses continues with the trial of an idolater, something that is not judged locally, in the town where he lives, but in the town in which he committed the crime. Subsequently, Moses deals with the problem of disagreements among members of the court, or several courts with one another. Such disagreements are also not to be judged locally but “in the place that the Lord has chosen,” (verse 8) i.e. the same court in which an elder who refuses to submit to the majority view of his colleagues is to be judged. ', 'לעבור בריתו, the covenant embracing all the commandments, for worshipping idols is an offence considered as equivalent to having violated all of the Torah’s commandments.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 17,3,"['אלוהים אחרים, independent ones, having no relation to Hashem  whatsoever, but disembodied beings. ולשמש או לירח, which are physical bodies;', 'אשר לא צויתי, which I had not appointed to act independently of My will. This is in contrast to the philosophers of idolatrous religions who believe that G’d had appointed His agents to be in charge of a city each, within which they have power over life and death without reference to their Master. The inhabitants of each such city are under the illusion that by pleasing the local agent of G’d, their “patron saint,” their fates will be affected beneficially.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 17,5,"['את האיש ההוא או את האשה ההיא, no mention is made in this connection of the idolatry being the result of seduction, the victim being foolish and knowing what he or she did, so that there is no need to convict him or her in the location where he or she committed the offence to teach the people who were aware of the sinner’s opinions that the truth is the opposite of what the sinner thought.', 'אל שעריך, to the public place where the idolatrous act was performed. By convicting and executing the idolater the public would have to admit that the deity worshipped by the convicted sinner was either unable or unwilling to save his life.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 17,6,"['על פי שנים עדים או שלושה, even if the charge is idolatry, the entire testimony is disqualified if one of the witnesses is found to be inadmissible. We do not rule that seeing there are a sufficient number of reliable and legally admissible witnesses left, we proceed with the trial on that basis.']"
Deuteronomy, 17,8,"['כי יפלא ממך, even though you have appointed competent judges in each town and city, in order that each court would dispense justice in its home base, if a doubt arises as to what the correct ruling is according to reliable tradition, the local court is not to hand down a ruling according to their opinion when it is not supported by authentic tradition, but the problem should be submitted to the Supreme Court, Sanhedrin. The same holds true when the judges in the local court were deadlocked.']"
Deuteronomy, 17,12,"['והאיש אשר יעשה בזדון, who deliberately hands down a ruling to be applied forthwith, which is against that handed down by the Supreme Court, ומת האיש ההוא, he is to be executed at the behest of the Supreme Court, and thereby all the people will hear about it and the absolute authority of the Sanhedrin will be preserved and the people will remain in awe of it.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 17,14,"['אשימה עלי מלך ככל הגויים, a monarch whose authority will be transferred from him to his biological heir after his death throughout the generations. This is quite different from judges, each of whom is appointed for his lifetime, with his heirs having absolutely no claim to succeed their father. The people were commanded to appoint such a hereditary position of king after they had conquered and settled in the land of Israel, the principal reason being to ensure that the Jewish people would not be like a flock without a shepherd, (Moses’ words in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.27.17"" data-ref=""Numbers 27:17"">Numbers 27,17</a>.) The fact is that G’d disapproved of a hereditary type of monarchy such as is customary among the gentile nations, so that He stipulated that if the people insisted on appointing a king who would start a dynasty, the initial king had to be approved not only by the people but by G’d’s representative on G’d’s behalf, as we know from <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.8.18"" data-ref=""I Samuel 8:18"">Samuel I 8,18</a>. The restrictions in appointing the original king were designed to ensure that such a king could not lead the people away from G’d’s Torah; on the contrary, they are meant for the people to see in him a shining example of Torah-observance, which in turn would inspire their own piety. Seeing that when the people asked Samuel for a king their purpose was far from what the Torah had legislated having a king for, the people were suitably punished as per the verse in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.8.18"" data-ref=""I Samuel 8:18"">Samuel I 8,18</a> that we referred to earlier. The prophet Hoseah 13,11 describes G’d granting the people’s wish as stemming from the fact that He was angry at them. Summing up, we may view the permission to appoint a king as being in the same category as the permission for a soldier to marry a physically attractive prisoner of war. G’d, the master psychologist, knows that sometimes in order to become wise enough to appreciate the Torah’s prohibitions, an individual, or even a whole nation, must find this out by having chosen in their own wisdom to ignore the Torah’s preferences. David’s experiences with his son Avshalom, born to such a prisoner of war whom he married because he was initially physically attracted to her, bears this out. In fact, his experience with his son Adoniah was not much better. (compare Tanchuma Ki Teytze, section 1).']"
Deuteronomy, 17,19,"['למען ילמד ליראה, in the philosophical, ethically instructive passages of the Torah acquainting us with the marvelous characteristics of G’d and His reluctance to interfere with man’s free choice. Such knowledge must lead one to revere G’d ever more.']"
Deuteronomy, 18,5,"[""כי בו בחר ה' אלוקיך מכל שבטיך, and it is therefore called for that you provide him with food and clothing in order that he will be free to perform the Temple service on your behalf.""]"
Deuteronomy, 18,8,"['לבד ממכריו אל האבות, the members of any priestly roster, known as בית אבות or as here. plain אבות, do not have the right to share their sacrificial meat with their relatives or friends except when this meat was part of the daily or weekly public offerings. These may be shared or exchanged between different rosters. However, any offerings brought to the altar on the pilgrimage festivals are not subject to the authority of the priestly roster officiating during that week at all. The expression ממכריו, “of his acquaintances,” does not apply to the days of the festivals. Therefore, the Torah orders that on that occasion basically any priest present may eat a share of such offerings regardless of whether he belongs to the roster of that particular week. This is why the Torah writes; חלק כחלק יאכלו, of the offerings presented during the festivals all the priests enjoy an equal share.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 18,10,"['לא ימצא בך, even among non-Jewish residents of the Holy Land. A prominent example would be the woman used by King Sha-ul to produce the deceased prophet Samuel to give him a message. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.28"" data-ref=""I Samuel 28"">Samuel I 28</a>)']"

Deuteronomy, 18,22,"['ולא יהיה הדבר, for when the prophet commands a “new” commandment, unless it is accompanied by a miracle attesting to his authority by G’d to do so, the fact that he failed to produced the promised miracle proves that he is a false prophet.

Deuteronomy, 19,2,"['שלוש ערים תבדיל, after Moses had explained the function of the judges, the king, the priests, and the prophets, Moses now details some of the tasks that fall under the jurisdiction of the judges, among them the establishment of the cities of refuge, the boundaries of the land, the examination of witnesses to establish that their testimony is truthful and accurate, and that they are acceptable as witnesses. Next, he deals with the tasks that fall within the competence of the king, such as leading the nation in war, especially aggressive wars beyond the boundaries of the land of Israel. (20, 1-9) The priests also have a role to play during the preparation of what are termed מלחמת רשות, “halachically permissible wars,” although they are not fought in order to repel invaders. The priests and judges cooperate in some of their duties, especially the עגלה הערופה, the calf killed when a murder in the field was unresolved. (21,1-9)\n']"

Deuteronomy, 20,1,"['כי תצא למלחמה, outside the boundaries of the land of Israel.

Deuteronomy, 21,16,"['לא יוכל לבכר את בן האהובה על פני בן השנואה הבכור.

Deuteronomy, 22,13,"['כי יקח איש אשה, after the Torah has dealt with matters concerning the settling of the people in the Land of Israel, it turns to instructions designed to ensure that the Shechinah, benevolent Divine presence, will maintain its beneficial presence there. One of the most important elements in ensuring this is the avoidance of forbidden mating and the offspring of such couplings. The Torah therefore addresses both forbidden incestuous relations amongst Jewish partners, and intermarriage or living together of Jews and Non-Jews without the benefit of “marriage,” something which is anyway legally impossible. All of this belongs to the headingוהיה מחניך קדוש ולא יראה בך ערות דבר ושב מאחריך, “your encampment shall be holy.

(<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Leviticus.20.15"" data-ref=""Leviticus 20:15"">Leviticus 20,15</a>). The difference is that the animal in question did not offer any resistance at all, whereas the woman in question in our verse initially did offer resistance. What happened to her is comparable to a murdered person who had been forced to commit a sin and who was murdered for having refused to do so.']"

Deuteronomy, 23,5,"['אשר לא קדמו, neither of these two nations met the Israelites, but the Moabites at least gave them bread and water in return for money, as we read in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.2.28-29"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 2:28-29"">Deut.  2, 28-29</a> כאשר עשו לי בני עשו היושבים בשעיר והמואבים היושבים בער, “as the Children of Esau who dwell in Seir did for me, as well as the Moabites who dwell in Or.” The Ammonites did not even sell us bread and water. However, the Moabites added to their sin of hostility by hiring the prophet Bileam to curse us. Therefore, לא תדרוש שלומם, for while neither of them have shown basic human civilities, the Moabites have even displayed open hostility.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 23,15,"['והיה מחניך קדוש, both free of ritual impurities as well as from repulsive things, even though not ritually impure.', 'ולא יראה בך ערות דבר, a description of Jewishly unfit offspring or some other impediment to G’d’s Shechinah resting over the Jewish people, as our sages (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Kiddushin.70"" data-ref=""Kiddushin 70"">Kidushin 70</a>) said: “the Shechinah rests only over the ancestrally pure Jewish families.” They added that anyone who can trace his ancestry to King David, (folio 76) by his ancestor having been a soldier in his army, is acceptable without question.', 'מאחריך, if you were to turn your rear to Him by ignoring these laws and thus insulting Him.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 23,16,"['לא תסגיר עבד אל אדוניו, after the Torah had spoken of the sanctity that must be prevalent in an encampment of Jewish soldiers in war, it switches to matters which are apt to happen in such surroundings, explaining how to correct deviations. One of these is how to deal with a gentile slave who has escaped from his master and taken asylum among the Jewish people; another is the subject of loose women who have infiltrated into the encampment of the Jewish army, an everyday occurrence in gentile armies. (verse 18)']"
Deuteronomy, 23,20,"['לא תשיך לאחיך, after warning us concerning behaviour the result of which is G’d’s withdrawing His benevolent presence from the Jewish people, He cautions us concerning the acts of loving kindness which would ensure the continued presence of His Shechinah. Two major steps in that direction are: 1) not to charge a fellow Jew interest on a loan extended to him, 2) not to be tardy in discharging the obligations assumed when making a vow in favour of G’d. (verse 22) These include vows representing donations to charity which are due without delay, seeing that there is never a shortage of people in need who have to be supported by charity.<br> Then there is the subject of what a labourer may eat when he is surrounded by fruit belonging to his employer, as well as the matter of divorce, something that must not be given to a woman unless she has been guilty of a serious misdemeanour, i.e. ערות דבר. (24,1) A major reason for granting a divorce is the effort to prevent bastards from being born. No other reason is considered as valid to divorce one’s wife, the prophet Maleachi 2,14 reminding people that at least G’d will testify against the husband who dealt treacherously with the wife he married in his youth and now abandoned.<br> The loving kindness performed with a newly wed (betrothed) woman is that her husband is given a chance to fulfill the commandment of making his bride joyful during the first year of their marriage. (24,5). The prohibition against taking as a pledge, i.e. collateral for overdue debts, tools needed for the debtor to make his living, such as millstones is self-evident. (24,6) Precautions against potential hazards that could hurt many people, prohibition against kidnappers coupled with the death penalty is a preventive measure, i.e. an act of kindness designed to protect parents against their children becoming the victims of such “stealing.” The isolation of people afflicted with the skin disease known as tzoraat, is all too well known. It not only prods the victim to mend his asocial behaviour, but it protects society at the same time. Cautions against tale-bearing and other forms of abuse of the power of speech are acts of kindness in respect of the potential victims of such slander. Not muzzling an ox while he threshes, is a show of understanding for the ox’s feelings in helping to provide food for its owner while himself being denied that same food. Etc. Etc.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 23,21,"['לנכרי תשיך, you are allowed to pay interest to the gentile (on your loan from him) and you must not betray his trust by citing the prohibition to charge or collect interest.', 'ולאחיך לא תשיך, even though according to the deal you made you obligated yourself to pay him interest and you are perfectly willing to pay same.', 'למען יברכך, in order that you will receive G’d’s blessing instead. By not desecrating G’d’s name in your dealings with the gentile by reneging, you will merit G’d’s blessing.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 23,22,"[""כי תדור נדר לה' אלוקיך, you are, of course, expected to honour your undertakings without reinforcing them in the form of a vow or oath. When you made a vow to G’d, however, not only are you obligated to pay up, but the payment must be made without undue delay."", 'כי דרוש ידרשנו, He will demand it of you,', ' so that if that becomes necessary you are already guilty of a sin of omission.']"

Deuteronomy, 24,16,"['לא יומתו אבות על בנים, even if the crime involved was insurrection against the established authority, king, etc. It had been a widely accepted rule that kings would also execute the family members of rebels in order to ensure that the surviving relatives of such executed rebels would not form an active opposition to the king as a result of their grievance. Such matters are referred to in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.14.21"" data-ref=""Isaiah 14:21"">Isaiah 14,21</a> “prepare a slaughtering block for his sons because of the guilt of their father. Let them not arise to possess the earth!

Amatziah, King of Yehudah, abided by this legislation when he executed the servants who had killed his father but did not touch their children (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Chronicles.25.3-4"" data-ref=""II Chronicles 25:3-4"">Chronicles II 25, 3-4</a>)\n']"

Deuteronomy, 25,6,"['ולא ימחה שמו מישראל, in that the child born from this union will be considered by G’d as if the deceased had fulfilled the commandment to be fruitful. This is easily understood when we consider that this child is the product of a legal marriage entered into by the deceased husband of his mother. The fact that the deceased’s brother did not have to go through a marriage ceremony with the widow of his brother makes this clear to everyone. This explains why G’d would be angry at the brother who refuses to marry his sister-in-law, as he thereby deprived his deceased brother forever from fulfilling the mitzvah of being fruitful']"
Deuteronomy, 25,9,"['ככה יעשה לאיש אשר לא יבנה את בית אחיו, he deserves this public embarrassment seeing he had refused to restore the house his deceased brother had begun to build when he betrothed his (now) widow. This reminds us of the statement in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.118"" data-ref=""Shabbat 118"">Shabbat 118</a> by Rabbi Yossi who did not refer to his wife as אשתי, “my wife,” but as ביתי, “my house.”']"
Deuteronomy, 25,11,"['וקרבה אשת האחד להציל את אישה, [the author, obliquely, established a conceptual link between this paragraph and that preceding it. Ed.] Even though the Torah had not only given permission to the widow in the yevamah legislation to publicly embarrass her brother in law for failing to do his duty by marrying her, but had even commanded her to do so, in this instance, when a wife tries to save her husband’s life by resorting to tactics which embarrass his opponent she is punished for doing so.']"
Deuteronomy, 25,14,"['לא יהיה לך בביתך איפה ואיפה, after having mentioned the ways in which the benevolent presence of the Shechinah can be assured for the Jewish people, the Torah reminds you that if G’d hates corrupt justice this is not an isolated instance of what G’d hates in interpersonal relations, something we call “civics,” He even hates it when someone owns and keeps instruments which are designed to be used in a corrupt, deceptive, manner, so that even without putting these instruments to use the owner/keeper has become guilty of violating  a negative commandment. G’d’s presence, Shechinah, cannot tolerate neighbours who even think of using such means to deceive others.']"

Deuteronomy, 26,2,"['מראשית כל פרי האדמה אשר תביא מארצך, the choicest of each category.

Deuteronomy, 26,3,"[""אל הכהן אשר יהיה בימים ההם, even if the priest in the particular generation may not be outstanding in wisdom, you must not therefore treat with less respect than his position warrants. This is why the Torah added the seemingly superfluous words לה' אלוקיך, words usually only used when addressing men of outstanding caliber such as kings and prophets. [If I understand correctly, the author mans that only high ranking people need to be reminded by implication that there is a higher authority than they themselves. Hence the addition of the words לה' אלוקיך after the word הגדתי.

The words there are: כי הגדת היום כי אין לך שרים ועבדים, “(by your excessive grieving) you have made clear that you do not consider that you have any loyal followers.”', 'כי באתי אל הארץ, that I have come to this land from another country אשר נשבע ה\' לאבותינו לתת לנו, as when G’d had said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.17.8"" data-ref=""Genesis 17:8"">Genesis 17,8</a> “I gave this land to you and to your descendants after you.” Seeing that G’d had sworn this oath at the time, I consider myself though apparently an outsider, a stranger, as if I am a permanent resident thanks to His gift, and this is why I have brought these choice fruit that it is incumbent upon anyone who has received the land as either a gift or even as a tenant to present to the real owner of the land in recognition of His largesse.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 26,4,"[""והניחו לפני מזבח ה' אלוקיך, to make plain by this gesture that these fruit are not really intended for the priest, but are a present to G’d, Who, in turn, gives them to the priest just as He does with other offerings brought to Him.""]"

Deuteronomy, 26,13,"['הקודש מן הבית, because of our and our fathers’ sins the privilege of performing Temple service was removed from the firstborn, who otherwise would also have been the recipients of all the various tithes. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.20.26"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 20:26"">Ezekiel 20,26</a> refers to this when he writes: ואטמא אותם במתנותם, בהעביר כל פטר רחם , “and I defiled them through their own gifts, when causing each first born to pass;” the prophet calls this line the ווידוי מעשר, the confession represented by the fact that the tithe cannot remain in the home but must be given to Levites who supplanted the family priest, the firstborn as a result of their having participated in the sin of the golden calf. (Maasser Sheyni 5,10)', 'וגם נתתיו ללוי, the meaning of the word גם in our context is the same as the words אף על פי, “even so.” We find the word גם used as אף על פי also in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ruth.1.12"" data-ref=""Ruth 1:12"">Ruth 1,12</a> when Naomi explains to her daughters-in-law that even if she were to get married immediately she would not be able to produce sons who could become the husbands of her daughters-in-law and thereby keep their deceased husbands’ names alive vicariously (symbolic levirate marriage). We must therefore perceive the farmer’s declaration to mean: “I confess that my sin was great so that as a result I am forced to destroy or remove all sacred things from my house even though I, personally, have discharged my duties by giving the Levite and his companions these tithes at Your command. Having done so, I pray that You will look down benevolently. Seeing that normally the word השקפה is used in Scripture as “looking down to confirm something negative,” the farmer had to add that he means that he has merited a benevolent השקפה as expressed by the plea וברך את עמך את ישראל, “and bless Your people, Israel, etc.”\n']"
Deuteronomy, 26,15,"['וברך את עמך...ואת האדמה אשר נתתה לי, in the same manner as You have sworn to our forefathers, when You swore to them: “I will take you up from the poverty in Egypt to a wide good land, etc.” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.3.17"" data-ref=""Exodus 3:17"">Exodus 3,17</a>)']"

The reason is that the sinners referred to were in the main the leaders of the people, so that the ordinary Israelite did not have the power to protest the carrying’s on of their leaders. This thought has been stated clearly by <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.22.6-7"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 22:6-7"">Ezekiel 22,6-7</a> “every one of the princes of Israel in their midst used his strength for the shedding of blood, etc. etc.” In that same chapter the prophet specifically singled out most of the (12) sins listed in our paragraph here. These obscenities were all carried out in Jerusalem; however, this does not mean that all the inhabitants of the city were guilty of these iniquities, mostly it was the highly placed members of society who were guilty of them. When the sins of the population at large are mentioned, these sins are generally attributed to the city in which these sins have been carried out. Compare verse 8 in that chapter of Ezekiel.

In recognition of this approved lifestyle of yours, the blessings G’d bestows on you can obviously not be described as something that you were actively pursuing. The blessings mentioned by Moses here were the ones that were in evidence during the period of the first Temple during the part of that period when the Jewish people did observe the commandments of the Torah, until verse 9 יקימך ה' לו לעם קדוש, a condition which was fulfilled at the beginning of the period of the Second Temple as described by Shimon Hatzaddik in Yuma 21 who reported on the manifestation of miracles in the Second Temple as proof of the fulfillment of that prophecy by Moses.""]"

Deuteronomy, 28,14,"[""Moses concludes the blessings applicable to the period of the Second Temple by warning ולא תסור מכל הדברים אשר אנכי מצוה אתכם היום ימין או שמאל, meaning that the people are not to introduce changes in the commandments of the Torah, and especially not to make any changes in the social legislation, משפטים. Neither are they to introduce variations in the observance of certain commandments which were part of the culture of nations that lived in the land of Canaan, and which had been well entrenched in the entire region. Especially, is this forbidden if by adopting those habits, which, though unrelated to idolatry and of no religious significance, you adopt them in order thereby to display some respect for the culture of the members of those tribes still residing in your midst. In the Torah’s view this would constitute ללכת אחרי אלוהים אחרים לעבדם, that you are on the path to adopt idolatrous practices, eventually even worshipping those idols. However, the admonitions up unto verse 36 i.e. יולך ה' אותך ואת מלכך, refer to periods during the Second Temple, the period of the Seleucids until the Hasmoneans started their uprising to rid the land of the Neo Greeks. Eventually, Aristobulus, a King of the Hasmonean Dynasty, was exiled by the Romans to Rome at the command of Pompey. Starting with this incident up until verse 63 ונסחתם, Moses refers to the period of the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans. What follows are admonitions dealing with our present exile.\n""]"
Deuteronomy, 28,15,"['אם לא תשמע בקול ה\' אלוקיך לשמור לעשות את כל מצותיו וחקותיו אשר אנכי מצוך היום, with these words Moses introduces his admonitions, the ones which parallel chapter 26 in Leviticus, but are sounding far more devastating. Israel is described as “backsliding,” having, with the help of Torah legislation, been the frontrunner in civilised countries. Whenever the Torah speaks about the Jewish people abandoning the laws of the Torah, the intention is not to make us think that they slid into anarchy, but worse, they slid into adopting the laws of the prevalent cultures and civilisations. Clearly, this is an even greater affront to G’d the Lawgiver, than merely being passive and not carrying out Torah legislation. Social legislation involving tithes was largely ignored, leading to such great scholars as Hillel, and the High Priest Yochanan decreeing legalistic means of circumventing the legislation so that the people would not be guilty of violating such basic social laws as forgiving overdue debts at the end of the Sh’mittah year. The Rabbis, in a number of instances, were forced to preserve the spirit of the law, sometimes at the expense of what may be termed “the letter of the law.” The discontinuance of the examination by the priest of a woman suspected of marital infidelity, Sotah, is one such example, the Rabbis feeling that when infidelity had become the norm rather than the exception, it would not do to demand a miracle from G’d every time such a situation arose. Moreover, the chances were that the husband’s sexual life was not so free from blemish that he could point a finger at his wife. (Compare Shviit,1,3, Maasser Sheyni 5,15, <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Sotah.46a.48"" data-ref=""Sotah 46a:48"">Sotah 46,48</a>,49) Other practices, such as referring disputes to pagan judges of the nation (Greeks or Romans) occupying Israel at the time, made it almost impossible for the Jewish judiciary, even when meaning to preside over Torah law, to be an effective legal instrument. All of these conditions became a self-fulfilling prophecy in the decline of the Jewish people as a holy nation and led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of Jewish independence on a land of their own.']"

Do not come to the mistaken conclusion that G’d will ever change and that the experiences that will befall the Jewish people during the course of history, and which I am about to foreshadow, are evidence of His changing and possibly becoming the Jewish people’s enemy. You are very well aware through the variety of miracles He has performed on your behalf that הצור, He remains the Rock and His actions are always motivated by pure motives. This being so, if at times He does not appear to help you, save you, this is not due to a weakening on His part, neither is He hard of hearing so that He did not hear your pleas; never ascribe any injustice to Him;', 'כל דרכיו משפט, all of His paths are justice;', 'א-ל אמונה, a totally reliable and loyal G’d is He; when He swore to the patriarchs that He would perform deeds of love for their children on account of these patriarchs’ merit;', 'ואין עול, never false, even when He visits retribution on you.', 'צדיק, because He is so righteous He will not abandon you even in exile', 'וישר הוא, not withholding from anyone of His creatures the reward due to it for any good deeds.

Deuteronomy, 32,5,"['שחת לו לא בניו מומם דור עקש ופתלתול, however, a twisted and perverse generation He does not view as His true children, such as when they made the golden calf. מומם, their blemish was not due to anything G’d had done Moses recalls that when G’d first told him about the people having become corrupt during his stay on the mountain that they were “your people” (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.32.7"" data-ref=""Exodus 32:7"">Exodus 32,7</a>), that although Moses, when accepting the conversion of the mixed multitude to Judaism had meant to sanctify the name of G’d, the fact was that instead of becoming a shining example to the world, these people had corrupted what would otherwise have been a kingdom of Priests. They had re-introduced idolatry among these people so recently weaned from it. \n']"
Deuteronomy, 32,6,"['הלה\' תגמלו זאת, after G’d had planned to make you superior over all other nations, is it indeed imaginable that you would respond by frustrating His intention by desecrating His name and to thereby prevent G’d from realising His declared intention when He created man that he should reflect the image of G’d?

Deuteronomy, 32,7,"['זכור ימות עולם, After concluding the introductory section of his poem, during the course of which he announced that it was his purpose to proclaim the perfect righteousness of the Lord G’d, Who has proven a loyal G’d showering goodness upon the people of Israel, and Who would not reverse a blessing once bestowed, Moses begins to discuss Israel’s past and future.<br> First, Moses reminds the people that G’d had originally hoped to bestow a brilliant future for all of mankind, i.e. ימות עולם, He had hoped that history would develop in that direction. When this failed to happen, שנות דור ודור, during the years of one generation after another, G’d decided on His pilot project the Jewish people and He raised them to an elevated position among the nations. This is basically what He will do at the end of “history,” [history is perceived as a period of education for the people filling or making a brief appearance on the stage of history. Ed.]<br> Second, G’d had provided the people with optimum conditions to serve Him joyfully while they enjoyed all the material advantages that life on earth has to offer. He gave them a beautiful country, one flowing with milk and honey, to do this in. Instead, they rebelled and repaid good with evil. There can be no question that the people responsible for frustrating G’d’s master plan deserve to be severely punished for this.<br> Third, due to the serious nature of their sin they deserve to be wiped out completely. If it were not for the desecration of the Lord’s name that would be a by-product of the destruction of His chosen people, nothing would have prevented G’d from administering this punishment.<br> Fourth, Moses reveals the reason why the redemption of the Jewish people will occur at the end of what we call “history,’ באחרית היים.<br>  Fifth, Moses elaborates somewhat on the nature of this redemption and the retribution G’d will wreak at that time on the other nations of the world. The nations will primarily be punished for what they did to the Jewish people throughout history. These then are the five sections into which the portion of Haazinu is divided, our sages having given us an easy way of reminding ourselves of this division by calling the portion הזי\'ו ל\'ך. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Rosh_Hashanah.31"" data-ref=""Rosh Hashanah 31"">Rosh Hashanah 31</a>) Moses therefore commences with the words: זכור ימות עולם, “study history and thereby learn to recognise how much G’d had endeavoured to shower good upon you, starting already with first man whom He transferred to Gan Eden, the most exclusive environment on earth.', 'בינו שנות דור ודור, you will then understand what amount of goodness G’d “squandered” on successive generations who did not deserve it. These generations of mankind, instead of appreciating it, did their best to ruin the universe until G’d was forced to put an end to them by bringing on the deluge.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 32,8,"['יצב גבולות עמים, after the tower of Babylon episode, when mankind had lived in a single community, G’d separated them, dividing them up, and established territorial boundaries for the various new nations. Instead of destroying the people who had engaged in building the tower as a challenge to G’d, He did not destroy them as He had the generation of the deluge, but limited their future scope of influence, by assigning only clearly marked territories within which they could be sovereign.', ""למספר בני ישראל. For the sake of the Children of Israel who were few in numbers, and who would eventually emerge from among these nations. Proof of all this is כי חלק ה' עמו, that G’d has no special claim on any nation other than the people of Israel. All the other nations worship alien deities. Moses explains that had it not been for the fact that G’d knew that the people of Israel would emerge eventually from among one of these nations, He would have wiped out all the people involved in the building of the tower.\n""]"

Although their specific deity will never become their adversary, they may fall within the power, the orbit of a competing deity, one that looks out for the interests of a different nation.

Deuteronomy, 33,2,"['ויאמר , before he commenced with his blessing in verse 25 with the words ברזל ונחושת מנעלך, he pronounced a list of prayers addressed not to the people but to G’d, in order to prepare the ground for his blessings when he intoned it to become effective. Words of blessing are invariably addressed to the recipient of the blessing directly.

Deuteronomy, 33,3,"['אף חובב עמים, he says to G’d that: “I am aware that You are fond of other peoples also, as when You said that the Jewish people are the most precious מכל העמים, from among all the nations, You meant that the species of mankind is something precious to G’d, as our sages said in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Pirkei_Avot.3.18"" data-ref=""Pirkei Avot 3:18"">Avot 3,18</a> חביב אדם שנברא בצלם, the species of man is especially dear to G’d among all of His creatures, seeing that only man has been created in the image of G’d.” [i.e. there are other nations to which Your relate with fondness.

(This is the meaning of Moses hearing the voice of the Lord speaking to him (only) in Numbers7,8 The word מדברותיך in this verse refers to the Torah, which was attributed to Moses, on account of the people preferring to hear its words from Moses’ mouth. This is why the Torah describes the people as saying תורה צוה לנו משה, “Moses has commanded the Torah to us,” instead of “G’d has commanded the Torah to us.” (verse 5)', 'מורשה קהלת יעקב, when something has not been acquired directly but is inherited, i.e. handed over from another owner, it is described in terms of ירושה, an inheritance.

Deuteronomy, 33,8,"['תומיך ואוריך לאיש חסידך, Moses refers to G’d having given to Aaron who was the outstanding member of the tribe of Levi, the pious tribe, the urim and tumim lodged within his breastplate pouch. The Talmud Yuma 73, derives from the above that any priest who speaks with holy spirit is of the calibre that when he employs the urim and tumim to address enquiries to G’d, he will receive G’d’s answer to such enquiries. Hence the word “איש,” a man of lofty spiritual standing, as if to underscore that character trait.

Deuteronomy, 33,20,"['ברוך מרחיב גד, Who has given him a larger tract of land on the east bank of the Jordan than any other tribe received even in that part of the country. For while it is true that the lands of Sichon and Og were larger in the number of square meters accorded to the tribes on the west bank, the latter were of the category known as “flowing with milk and honey,” whereas the land on the east bank was primarily grazing land as opposed to “homesteading” land, i.e. farming land.', 'כלביא שכן, he deserves the extra acreage as he holds his own against enemies that surround him and he behaves like a brave courageous lion though badly outnumbered. Such a lion does not hesitate to devour what is around him.\n']"
Deuteronomy, 33,21,"['וירא ראשית לו, he was also entitled to this, although when the tribe of Gad chose lands formerly belonging to Sichon or Og, a land which was not part of the “Holy Land,” there had been additional motivation to that of having good grazing land for their flocks, namely that their part of the land would contain Moses’ burial place. This is the meaning of the reference to מחוקק, “the legislator” in our verse.', 'ויתא ראשי עם, this was where the leaders of the people came together at the head of the nation in order to conquer the land.', 'צדקת ה\' עשה ומשפטיו עם ישראל, this was where the legislator, מחוקק, performed the righteous deeds of Hashem, by explaining to them G’d’s Torah in detail.

The reason why I am certain that my blessing will materialise is that אין כא-ל רוכב שמים וארץ, no one else has a G’d that rides the heavens and the earth. Moses develops a theological/philosophical concept that contradicts that of the nations of the world, even those who recognise a supreme G’d who has created the universe. In their estimation, such a  G’d would not bother to constantly stoop down to earth to see what goes on there, i.e. “ride both the heavens and the earth.” These nations believe that such matters must be left to delegates, such as the constellations of the stars, horoscopes, etc.']"

Our sages subscribe to the concept that whatever Moses did had enduring, eternal validity, provided it had been based on a valid premise. A blessing after setting foot in the Holy Land would have been of more enduring value than one pronounced when not on holy soil. Denying Moses the chance to pronounce his blessing while on holy soil, indirectly benefited the whole generation of the people who were adults at the time of the Exodus. It preserved their chance to participate in the resurrection, as did the fact that Moses was buried outside the Holy Land, and his appearance at the resurrection without the people whom he had shepherded for 40 years would be embarrassing for him. Ed.]\n']"
Deuteronomy, 34,6,"['ויקבור אותו, if Moses buried himself, as is the opinion of some of our commentators, (compare Rashi) it would have been his disembodied soul that accomplished this, for it is stated clearly that his body died on the summit of the mountain from which he viewed the Holy Land, as the Torah wrote in verse 5: “Moses died there.” On the other hand, the burial is described in our verse as having taken place in the valley.']"
Deuteronomy, 34,8,"['ויתמו ימי בכי אבל משה ויהושוע בן נון מלא רוח חכמה, for during the days of weeping for Moses there was neither wisdom nor counsel (חכמה ועצה).\n']"
Deuteronomy, 34,9,"['כאשר צוה ה\' את משה, a reference to the fact that political decisions such as expansionary wars needed G’d’s confirmation, which was to be obtained by means of the urim vetumim in the breastplate of the High Priest, i.e. Eleazar, son of Aaron. We were told this in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.27.21"" data-ref=""Numbers 27:21"">Numbers 27,21</a> when Joshua was appointed Moses’ successor. [This was an example of Joshua’s inferiority as a leader compared to Moses, who never had to resort to such indirect methods of receiving a message from G’d. Ed.]\n']"
Deuteronomy, 34,10,"['ולא קם נביא עוד בישראל כמשה, no other subsequent prophet ever attained the lofty spiritual stature of Moses. This explained the statement by our sages that no prophet is allowed to innovate something in the Torah since Moses had died. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Shabbat.104"" data-ref=""Shabbat 104"">Shabbat 104</a>) This statement also explains the rule that no Rabbinical assembly may invalidate a decree by another such Rabbinical assembly which had preceded it, unless it could be proven to be more competent and consisted of a greater number than the Rabbinical assembly which had originated said decree. (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Megillah.20"" data-ref=""Megillah 20"">Megillah 20</a>)', '\'אשר ידעו ה, whom G’d had endowed with so much knowledge by turning His face to him. We have been told in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.10.6"" data-ref=""I Samuel 10:6"">Samuel I 10,6</a> that receiving even a small measure of prophetic insight makes the recipient an איש אחר, a different person. This is why the prophet <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Amos.2.11"" data-ref=""Amos 2:11"">Amos 2,11</a> when referring to the deeds of loving kindness performed by G’d for the people lists the fact that G’d gave many Israelites prophetic insights. The people, during Amos’ time, instead of availing themselves of the spiritual inspiration thus accessible, forbade these prophets to impart their visions, etc., reversing and frustrating G’d’s purpose. Seeing that all of G’d’s activity stems exclusively from His own personal knowledge (cannot be evaluated properly by His creatures, seeing that they are “only” His creature) the Torah records G’d as saying that  אשר ידעו ה\' פנים אל פנים, that in His communications with Moses and granting him insights into His ways, He did so exclusively for Moses’ benefit. This expression ידע appears repeatedly in Scriptures in this sense of endowing someone with insights. One example is <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.144.3"" data-ref=""Psalms 144:3"">Psalms 144,3</a> מה אדם ותדעהו, “what did man do that You should take the trouble to grant him such insights?” Another such example is found in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.17"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:17"">Exodus 33,17</a> ואדעך בשם, “I granted you some insights about My essence, by making you familiar with some of My attributes.” [my translation. Ed.] Compare also <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.25"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:25"">Exodus 2,25</a> Psalms1,6 and numerous other examples. [If I do not err, the author feels that seeing that G’d’s omniscience is axiomatic in Judaism, such phrases as the ones quoted cannot simply mean “G’d knew,” for there would be no point in the Torah stating the obvious. They must therefore imply that G’d communicated some of His knowledge. In <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.25"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:25"">Exodus 2,25</a> the Torah meant to tell us that the Jewish people would shortly become aware that G’d knew all about their condition and would do something about it, something that would also raise their spiritual level as a result. Ed.]', 'פנים אל פנים, while in full possession of his faculties.']"
Deuteronomy, 34,11,"['לכל האותות, the occasion when Moses experienced this type of communication from G’d described as פנים אל פנים occurred when he was called upon to perform the many supernatural miracles in Egypt. Clearly, his experience at the burning bush had not been of that calibre. Otherwise, why would the Torah have told us that he was afraid to look at the spectacle? (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.3.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 3:6"">Exodus 3,6</a>)  This had been the very opposite of what G’d told Miriam and Aaron about his quality of prophecy in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.12.8"" data-ref=""Numbers 12:8"">Numbers 12,8</a> i.e. that Moses can look without hesitation at visual images G’d shows him.']"
Deuteronomy, 34,12,"['ולכל היד, and when G’d demonstrated His power over immanent parts of the universe such as the Sea of Reeds, when He split it, or the earth when He made it open a crevice to swallow Korach and his cohorts, or when the manna descended from heaven on a regular basis.', 'ולכל המורא הגדול, the revelation at Mount Sinai;', 'אשר עשה משה לעיני כל בני ישראל, when they were afraid and stood at a distance, whereas Moses approached the mountain which was wrapped in a dark cloud, while it was flaming. During such experiences Moses had acquired the status of a prophet with whom G’d communicates פנים אל פנים  At that time G’d also endowed Moses with a kind of awesomeness when He made his forehead emit rays of light.', 'לעיני כל ישראל, compare <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.34.30"" data-ref=""Exodus 34:30"">Exodus 34,30</a> when even Aaron recoiled when he saw Moses. \n']"
