Genesis,1,1,"['IN THE BEGINNING. Our wise men<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew grammarians. See Ibn Janah, <i>Sefer ha-Rikmah</i>, 6:2.</i> taught that the letter <i>bet</i> (of <i>bereshit</i>, in the beginning) is superfluous.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The letter <i>bet</i> placed before the word <i>reshit</i> has no translatable meaning. According to Weiser it is there for emphasis. Our verse should thus be rendered: First God created heaven and earth.</i> They compare it to the <i>bet</i> in the word <i>ba-rishonah</i> (at the first) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.13.4"" data-ref=""Genesis 13:4"">Genesis 13:4</a>). We know the <i>bet</i> in <i>ba-rishonah</i> to be superfluous for we find <i>they shall set forth first</i> (rishonah) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.2.9"" data-ref=""Numbers 2:9"">Numbers 2:9</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">According to this opinion <i>rishonah</i> and <i>ba-rishonah</i> mean the same. Hence the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i> is superfluous.</i> However, if this were so the <i>bet</i> (of <i>bereshit</i>) would be vocalized with a long <i>kamatz</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">As is the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i>. The fact that the <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> proves that both cases are not exactly the same.</i> Other scholars maintain that the word <i>bereshit</i> is always in the construct and its meaning in our verse is: “In the beginning of the evening, or of the night, or of the darkness.”<sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">The word or phrase that <i>bereshit</i> is connected to is missing and must be supplied by the reader. According to Cherez, I.E. is trying to explain why the superfluous <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> while that of <i>ba-rishonah</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>. The reason is that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct and therefore is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>.</i> However, they have overlooked <i>And he chose a first part</i> (reshit) <i>for himself</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.33.21"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 33:21"">Deuteronomy 33:21</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">Where the word <i>reshit</i> is in the absolute.</i> Others say that the <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is a preposition.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew texts printed in our editions are most probably incorrect. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38, which has <i>kli ta’am</i> rather than <i>bli ta’am</i>. For alternate interpretations see Filwarg, Weiser and Cherez.</i> They explain that Scripture intends to preclude the thought that heaven and earth were preexisting. Hence it states, <i>In the beginning</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>bet</i> is there for emphasis. The meaning of the verse is: <i>In the</i> beginning, i.e., before anything was created, God created heaven and earth.</i> I believe that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct, as in <i>In the beginning of</i> (bereshit) <i>the reign of Jehoiakim</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Jeremiah.26.1"" data-ref=""Jeremiah 26:1"">Jeremiah 26:1</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">I.E. agrees that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct. He disagrees with the earlier quoted opinion only in maintaining that it is not always in the construct.</i> Don’t ask, how can a word in the construct be connected to a verb in the perfect.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">A noun is usually in the construct when connected to another noun, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> This presents no problem, for we find that very case in the verse <i>When the Lord spoke at first with Hosea</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Hosea.1.2"" data-ref=""Hosea 1:2"">Hosea 1:2</a>),<sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Techillat</i> (at first) is in the construct with <i>dibber</i> (spoke).</i> and in the verse <i>the city where David encamped</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.29.1"" data-ref=""Isaiah 29:1"">Isaiah 29:1</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">12</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Kiryat</i> (the city) is in the construct with <i>chanah</i> (encamped).</i> The meaning of <i>bereshit</i> will be explained in our comments on the next verse.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote"">That is, the explanation of what <i>bereshit</i> in the construct is to be connected to.</i>', 'CREATED. Most Biblical commentators explain that the word <i>bara</i> (created) indicates creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. <i>But if the Lord make</i> (yivra) <i>a new thing</i> (beri’ah) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Numbers.16.30"" data-ref=""Numbers 16:30"">Num. 16:30</a>) is similar. However, they have overlooked <i>And God created</i> (va-yivra) <i>the great sea monsters</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">14</sup><i class=""footnote"">God obviously did not create the sea monsters <i>ex nihilo</i>, for the verse concludes, <i>and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed</i>, which shows that the sea monsters were created out of the water. Also, it is absurd to assume that on the fifth day of creation God would create sea monsters <i>ex nihilo</i>.</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.21"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:21"">Gen. 1:21</a>) and the three times the word created is used in one verse, viz., <i>And God created</i> (va-yivra) <i>man in His own image, in the image of God created</i> (bara) <i>He him; male and female created</i> (bara) <i>He them</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Genesis.1.27"" data-ref=""Genesis 1:27"">Gen. 1:27</a>). They also failed to consider <i>I form the light, and create darkness</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.45.7"" data-ref=""Isaiah 45:7"">Is. 45:7</a>) wherein darkness, which is the opposite of light, an existing entity, is described by the prophet as being created.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">Darkness is the absence of light. Thus Isaiah uses the term created in the opposite sense of creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. In Isaiah it means the creation of nothing out of something (Krinsky). Hence <i>bara</i> does not necessarily imply creation <i>ex nihilo</i>.</i> The following is the precise explanation of the word <i>bara</i>. <i>Bara</i> has two meanings, one of which has been noted above.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">That is, to create or make.</i> The second<sup class=""footnote-marker"">17</sup><i class=""footnote"">That is, to eat.</i> is found in the verse <i>neither did he eat</i> (bara) <i>bread with them</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.12.17"" data-ref=""II Samuel 12:17"">II Samuel 12:17</a>). However, in the latter case, an <i>alef</i> has been substituted for a <i>heh</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">18</sup><i class=""footnote"">Most of our manuscripts of the Bible have <i>barah</i> with a <i>heh</i>. However, Ibn Ezra’s manuscript must have had <i>bara</i> with an <i>alef</i>. See also Jacob ben Haim’s edition of the Hebrew Bible, 1524, which has the same reading as Ibn Ezra. There is some difficulty in understanding this comment as the printed text is corrupt. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 as suggested by Weiser. For a different rendering see Filwarg.</i> The reason is that <i>bara</i> (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.12.17"" data-ref=""I Samuel 12:17"">I Sam. 12:17</a>) is similar to <i>le-havrot</i> (to urge to eat) in <i>And all the people came to cause David to eat</i> (le-havrot) <i>bread</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/II_Samuel.3.35"" data-ref=""II Samuel 3:35"">II Sam. 3:35</a>). The verb <i>le-havrot</i> appears in the <i>hifil</i> (and its root ends with <i>heh</i>), for if it ended with an <i>alef</i>, Scripture would have read <i>le-havri</i>, as in <i>to make yourselves fat</i> (le-havri’achem) <i>with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.2.29"" data-ref=""I Samuel 2:29"">I Sam. 2:29</a>). We also find <i>bara</i> conjugated in the <i>pi’el</i>, as in <i>and cut down</i> (u-vereta) <i>for thyself (trees)</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.17.15"" data-ref=""Joshua 17:15"">Joshua 17:15</a>). This is not like the similar word <i>beru</i> in <i>choose</i> (beru) <i>you a man for you</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.17.8"" data-ref=""I Samuel 17:8"">I Sam. 17:8</a>) but rather like <i>bare</i> (hack, dispatch) in <i>and dispatch them</i> (u-vare) <i>with their swords</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">19</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibn Janah, <i>The Book of Roots</i>, root <i>bet, resh, alef</i>, explains <i>bara</i> in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.17.15"" data-ref=""Joshua 17:15"">Josh. 17:15</a> to mean chose, as in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.17.8"" data-ref=""I Samuel 17:8"">I Sam. 17:8</a>. Ibn Ezra disagrees. The point of I.E’s comment is that <i>bara</i> spelled <i>bet, resh, alef</i> primarily means to cut. It is encountered with this meaning in both the <i>kal</i> and <i>pi’el</i>. <i>Bara</i> also means to eat. However, in the latter case its root is <i>bet, resh, heh</i>, although it is found spelled <i>bet, resh, alef</i> in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.17.8"" data-ref=""I Samuel 17:8"">I Sam. 17:8</a>. In the latter instance, however, we treat it as if there were an interchange between the <i>heh</i> and <i>alef</i>.</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Ezekiel.23.47"" data-ref=""Ezekiel 23:47"">Ezekiel 23:47</a>). The meaning of <i>bara</i> is to cut or to set a boundary. The intelligent person will understand what I am alluding to.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">20</sup><i class=""footnote"">I. Husik, <i>A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</i>, p. 190, notes, “The Hebrew word <i>bara</i>, ordinarily translated “created,” which implies to most people the idea of <i>creatio ex nihilo</i>, Ibn Ezra renders, in accordance with its etymology, to limit, to define, by drawing or incising a line or boundary. Having said this, Ibn Ezra, in his wonted mysterious manner, stops short, refusing to say more, and preferring to mystify the reader by adding the tantalizing phrase, ‘The intelligent will understand.’ He means apparently to indicate that an eternal matter was endowed with form.” Nahman Krochmal, <i>More Nevuche Ha-zeman</i> (quoted by Krinsky), suggests that Ibn Ezra’s belief is similar to that of the Kabbalists; i.e., the world was created out of an emanation from God. See also C. Sirot, <i>Philosophy in the Middle Ages</i> (Hebrew), p. 112. Ibn Ezra was a neo-Platonist. According to neo-Platonism the world came about by emanation from God. Ibn Ezra is apparently saying that at the creation spoken of in the first chapter of Genesis, God gave final form to what had previously emanated from Him.</i>', 'GOD. <i>Elohim</i> (God) is a plural. We know this because we come across the singular form <i>Elo’ah</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">21</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ps. 114:7. <i>Elo’ah</i> being the singular of <i>Elohim</i>.</i> <i>Elohim</i> is employed stylistically. Every language has honorific terminology. In the non-Hebrew tongues when an inferior addresses a superior he employs the plural. In Arabic it is customary for a dignitary such as a king to speak in the plural. In Hebrew, too, it is considered a sign of dignity to employ the plural when speaking of a superior. Such is the case with the words <i>adonim</i> (lords) and <i>be’alim</i> (owners). Thus Scripture says, <i>a cruel lord</i> (adonim) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.19.4"" data-ref=""Isaiah 19:4"">Is. 19:4</a>),<sup class=""footnote-marker"">22</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Adonim</i> is a plural, yet its meaning in this verse is singular (lord). The singular of <i>adonim</i> is <i>adon</i>.</i> and <i>and the owner thereof</i> (be’alav) <i>shall accept it</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.22.10"" data-ref=""Exodus 22:10"">Exodus 22:10</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">23</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Be’alav</i> literally means, its owners.</i> The terms <i>alav</i> (upon him), <i>elav</i> (to him), and <i>adav</i> (unto him) are similar.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">24</sup><i class=""footnote"">All of these words have plural endings, yet are used to indicate singulars.</i> It is for this reason that Scipture reads <i>bara Elohim</i> and not <i>bare’u Elohim</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">25</sup><i class=""footnote"">Since <i>Elohim</i> is to be understood as singular, the verb following it (<i>bara</i>) is in the singular. If <i>Elohim</i> were plural, the verb following it would also be plural (<i>bare’u</i>).</i> We know from the study of logic that speech is called <i>safah</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">26</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Safah</i> is the Hebrew word for lip. The point is that more than the lips are involved in speech, but speech is so called because it is seen to come from the lips.</i> because it is seen to come from the lips. Similarly man’s highest soul is called heart (<i>lev</i>) even though the soul itself is incorporeal while the heart is corporeal. It is referred to in this manner because the heart is its first resting place. Similarly God is called <i>Elohim</i> because His actions are executed via angels who do His will and who are referred to as <i>Elohim</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">27</sup><i class=""footnote"">Man’s soul is often referred to in Scripture as <i>lev</i> because the soul acts via the heart. Similarly God is called <i>Elohim</i> because He acts via the angels. Husik, p. 191, points out that according to I.E., “God cannot come in contact with the material and changeable (hence)…it follows that (the terrestrial world)…was not made directly by him, but by angels; hence the word <i>Elohim</i> is used in the first chapter of Genesis, which means primarily the angels, and secondarily God as acting through the angels.”</i> I will explain part of the secret of God’s name when I comment on <i>for My name is in him</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.23.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 23:21"">Ex. 23:21</a>). Pay no heed to the opinion of Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who holds that man is superior to the angels. I have already explained to you in <i>The Book of Foundation</i> that all of his proofs are wrong. We know that the prophets are the most exalted human beings. Nevertheless, the prophet Joshua fell upon his face and prostrated himself before God’s angel and said to him, <i>What saith my lord unto his servant</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Joshua.5.14"" data-ref=""Joshua 5:14"">Josh. 5:14</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">28</sup><i class=""footnote"">Joshua’s bowing before God’s angels proves that angels are superior to prophets.</i> The same is true of the prophets Zechariah and Daniel.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">29</sup><i class=""footnote"">Both address the angels as superiors. See <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Zechariah.1.9"" data-ref=""Zechariah 1:9"">Zechariah 1:9</a> and <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Daniel.10.17"" data-ref=""Daniel 10:17"">Dan. 10:17</a>.</i> Why should I elaborate when this point is so elementary?The meaning of Lord of Hosts (<i>Elohe ha-tzeva’ot</i>) is the same as <i>God of gods</i> (<i>Elohe ha-Elohim</i>) (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.10.17"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 10:17"">Deut. 10:17</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">30</sup><i class=""footnote"">We thus see that <i>Elohim</i> means the same as <i>tzeva’ot</i> (hosts or angels).</i> The definition of <i>elohim</i> (lord) is angels.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">31</sup><i class=""footnote"">Reading <i>malakh</i> (angel) rather than <i>melekh</i> (king) (Weiser).</i> People engaged in the dispensation of God’s justice are also called <i>elohim</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">32</sup><i class=""footnote"">According to Rabbinic interpretation <i>Elohim</i> at times signifies a judge. See <i>Mekhilta</i> on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.21.6"" data-ref=""Exodus 21:6"">Ex. 21:6</a>.</i> <i>Elohim</i> is an adjective, not a proper noun.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">33</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hence it can be declined and be in the construct. A proper noun cannot. I.E. seems to limit the term noun to proper nouns. Apparently common nouns were treated like adjectives.</i> It is not found conjugated in the perfect or imperfect.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">34</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hebrew adjectives have verbal forms. However, <i>Elohim</i> is never found in the verbal form. Nevertheless, Ibn Ezra insists that it is an adjective.</i> One should not assume that angels are composed of fire and air because Scripture states, <i>Who makest winds Thy messengers, The flaming fire Thy ministers</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.4"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:4"">Psalms 104:4</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">35</sup><i class=""footnote"">Which implies that God makes his angels out of wind.</i> This is not the literal meaning of this verse. David (in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104"" data-ref=""Psalms 104"">Psalm 104</a>) speaks first of creation. He starts with light and says, <i>Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.2"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:2"">Ps. 104:2</a>). He then goes on to say, <i>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</i>, heaven referring to the firmament upon which is water, fire, snow and wind. David next says that the wind serves as God’s agent; i.e., it goes wherever God sends it. He speaks in a similar vein of fire as one of God’s ministers.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">36</sup><i class=""footnote"">Psalm 104. It is not to be taken as implying that the angels are made out of fire. It rather means that fire is God’s agent. Cf. Ibn Ezra on <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.4"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:4"">Ps. 104:4</a>.</i> David then says, <i>Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104.5"" data-ref=""Psalms 104:5"">Ps. 104:5</a>), which refers to dry land. Similarly it is written, <i>Stormy wind, fulfilling His word</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.148.8"" data-ref=""Psalms 148:8"">Ps. 148:8</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">37</sup><i class=""footnote"">Which shows that the wind is God’s agent. Krinsky suggests that this quote is misplaced and should follow, “it (the winds) goes wherever God sends it.”</i>', '<i>Et</i> indicates the very thing. It signifies the direct object, as in <i>the heaven</i> (et ha-shamayim).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">38</sup><i class=""footnote"">Gen. 1:1. The word <i>et</i> is a most difficult word to translate because it has many different meanings, depending on the context.</i> However, sometimes it is omitted, as in <i>that God created man</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Deuteronomy.4.32"" data-ref=""Deuteronomy 4:32"">Deut. 4:32</a>). It is also found placed before the subject, as in <i>and when there came a lion, or</i> (ve-et) <i>a bear</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/I_Samuel.17.34"" data-ref=""I Samuel 17:34"">I Sam. 17:34</a>). However, the latter usage is very rare. Furthermore, <i>et</i> is used in place of with or from.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">39</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.2.21"" data-ref=""Exodus 2:21"">Ex. 2:21</a>; 9:29.</i>', 'THE HEAVEN. The definite article (<i>ha</i>) is placed before heaven (<i>shamayim</i>) to indicate that Scripture speaks of the heaven visible to man.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">40</sup><i class=""footnote"">That is, the firmament. According to I.E. there is a heaven above the firmament which is invisible to man. This heaven is eternal. It contains the spheres in which the planets and constellations are embodied. Above this heaven is the abode of the angels. Cf. Husik, p. 190.</i> Heaven (<i>shamayim</i>) is always written in the plural.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">41</sup><i class=""footnote"">The word <i>shamayim</i> (heaven) is a plural.</i> It is possible that <i>its dominion</i> in <i>Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens</i>? <i>Canst thou establish its dominion over the earth</i>?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">42</sup><i class=""footnote"">In this verse <i>its dominion</i> is in the singular. Since <i>shamayim</i> is a plural, we would expect “their dominion” rather than “its dominion.”</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Job.38.33"" data-ref=""Job 38:33"">Job 38:33</a>) refers to the dominion exercised by each one of the heavenly spheres.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">43</sup><i class=""footnote"">See note 40 above. See also Ibn Ezra’s Introduction, page XVII, second paragraph.</i> The meaning of <i>shamayim</i> (heaven) is high and above, as it is in Arabic, a language akin in form to Hebrew. There is also a heaven of heavens.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">44</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.148.4"" data-ref=""Psalms 148:4"">Ps. 148:4</a>. Scripture in our chapter speaks of the visible heaven. However, in <a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.148"" data-ref=""Psalms 148"">Psalm 148</a> it speaks of the “heaven of heavens.” The <i>heaven of heavens</i> is the spheres (Krinsky). See note 40.</i> The word for heaven (<i>shamayim</i>) is never written in the singular.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">45</sup><i class=""footnote"">Even if the reference is to one of the heavens.</i> It is like the words millstone (<i>rechayim</i>) and noon (<i>tzohorayim</i>). Those who are well-versed in geometry will understand these secrets.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">46</sup><i class=""footnote"">They will understand the reference to the heaven of heavens.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that the earth may be compared to a point and the heaven to a thread circling it. Since Scripture tells us that heaven and earth were created, we deduce from this that all their contents, such as fire and water, were also created.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">47</sup><i class=""footnote"">Scripture does not explicitly mention the creation of fire and water, two of the four elements. However, according to Saadiah the creation of these two elements is implied. There was no need for Scripture to mention their creation as their creation is self evident. For how could the fire and water, which filled the void between heaven and earth, be in existence before the creation of their container? Cf. I.E.’s alternate commentary on this verse in Weiser, p. 145.</i> Others say that the earth includes water and the heaven air.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">48</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hence Scripture does state that these two elements were created.</i> However, in my opinion the heaven and earth spoken of in our verse refer only to the firmament and the dry land.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">49</sup><i class=""footnote"">Gen. 1:1 does not tell us that God created heaven and earth on the first day; neither does it deal with the creation of matter. I.E. will explain the meaning of this verse later on in his comments.</i> For only one thing was created on each day. Thus light was created on the first day, the firmament on the second, plants on the third, luminaries on the fourth, and living creatures on the fifth and the sixth. This interpretation is borne out by the psalm quoted above (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.104"" data-ref=""Psalms 104"">Psalm 104</a>). It is impossible to maintain that the line circling the dot was created before the dot, or the dot before the circle. Hence our sages say that heaven and earth were created simultaneously.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">50</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Hagigah</i> 12a.</i> They offer as proof of their viewpoint, <i>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens; When I call unto them, They stand up together</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Isaiah.48.13"" data-ref=""Isaiah 48:13"">Is. 48:13</a>).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">51</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>They stand up together</i> implies that they were created simultaneously.</i> However, this proof is questionable. The plain meaning of this verse is not so, for how could God address that which was not yet created?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">52</sup><i class=""footnote"">How can the Bible say, “When I call unto them,” if they were not yet in being?</i> How could He call to that which was in a chaotic state? The explanation of this verse is as follows: I, God, created heaven and earth. When I call them, they stand before Me as servants ready to do My will. The meaning of this verse is similar to that of <i>Thy word standeth fast in heaven</i> (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.119.89"" data-ref=""Psalms 119:89"">Ps. 119:89</a>). After stating this the Psalmist makes mention of the earth (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.119.90"" data-ref=""Psalms 119:90"">Ps. 119:90</a>). He then goes on to say that heaven and earth stand ready to execute any commands that God will direct to them (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Psalms.119.91"" data-ref=""Psalms 119:91"">Ps. 119:91</a>).']"
Exodus,1,1,"['May the writer and the reader be strong and steadfast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">This poem is found in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.

However, other commentaries give the date 4927 (1166-67 C.E.) as the date of the manuscript’s completion. E. Levine notes, “Some writers have held that the 1152-53 date refers to the long commentary whereas the inscription 1166-67 refers to the short commentary; others have maintained that the 1152-53 refers to the short commentary and the 1166-67 refers to the long commentary which was written precisely between 1159 and 1167 C.E.” See Foreword.</i> in the very ark<sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">In Hebrew, <i>ba-aron be-kemutzot</i>.

Similarly, Exodus should have read <i>elleh shemot</i> and not <i>ve-elleh shemot</i>.</i> because the end of Genesis relates that <i>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</i> (Genesis 50:23).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Genesis concludes by relating that <i>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</i>, i.e., that he was fruitful.

The latter is related to us at the beginning of Exodus where we are told that <i>the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly</i> (Ex. 1:7). Thus the opening part of Exodus is connected to the closing section of Genesis. Hence the connective <i>vav</i>.</i> Scripture notes that Joseph’s brothers were few in number when they descended to Egypt but that they were fruitful and multiplied there (Exodus 1:7).The word <i>elleh</i> (these) and <i>el</i> (these) are employed equally with the masculine and the feminine.

We similarly read, <i>unto these men</i> (la-anashim ha-el) (Gen. 19:8); <i>These four</i> (arba’at elleh) <i>were born to the giant</i> (II Samuel 21:22); <i>and what can I do this day for these</i> (la-elleh) <i>my daughters</i> (Gen. 31:43).

The fact that the word <i>elleh</i> is penultimately accented indicates that its <i>heh</i> is superfluous.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">The basic word being <i>el</i>.

The three confessions offered by the high priest were on behalf of himself (<i>for himself</i>), on behalf of the house of Aaron (<i>his household</i>), and on behalf of the people of Israel (<i>and for all the assembly of Israel</i>).</i> The priest’s helpmate, who is his wife, is included in the term <i>for himself</i>.

I.E. believes that circumcision is also a sign not to act promiscuously. I.E. writes, “The excision of the foreskin of the flesh is a sign of the covenant between man and his creator not to defile one’s soul by engaging in an act of sexual intercourse that is not in accordance with the way of truth” (<i>Yesod Morah</i>, (Strickman translation, p. 102).</i> It is also possible for one commandment to have many reasons. The commandment regarding the burnt offering and the sacrifice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">The other sacrifices.</i> are examples of the latter, for when the officiant offers each part<sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Of the sacrifice.</i> in its proper time, then the part<sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">The person.

In strict regard to the words of the text, we think that he died in the days of Hezekiah; for had he lived in the days of Manasse, the son of Hezekiah, it would certainly have been stated in this verse. Some say that Isaiah was slain by Manasse, because he exclaimed, Mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts (6:5).<sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Manasse is said to have tried and condemned Isaiah for having declared that he had seen the Lord, in contradiction to the words of the Law, There shall no man see me and live (<a class =""refLink"" href=""/Exodus.33.20"" data-ref=""Exodus 33:20"">Exod. 33:20</a>); comp.

Malachi,1,1,"['There are those that say that he is Ezra. According to my opinion that is his name, and he is the last of the prophets, and that is why he warns, ""remember the Torah of Moshe the prophet"" because when he died there was no more prophecy in Israel.']"
