Genesis,2,5,"All the plants of the field were not yet on the earth, and all the herbal vegetation of the field had not yet sprouted, for Adonoy Elohim had not brought rain [<b>down</b>] upon the earth, and there was [yet] no man to work the soil."
Genesis,2,6,"A mist rose up from the earth, and it watered the entire surface of the soil."
Genesis,2,7,"Adonoy Elohim then formed the man, dust from the ground, and He blew into his nostrils the breath of life. And so man became a living [<b>speaking</b>] soul."

Genesis,2,21,Adonoy Elohim caused unconsciousness to fall upon the man and he slept. He took one of his ribs and closed over [<b>filled</b>] flesh in its place.
Genesis,2,22,"Adonoy Elohim built the rib that He took from the man into a woman, and He brought her to the man."
Genesis,2,23,"The man said: This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called Woman, for from Man [<b>husband</b>] was she taken."

Genesis,3,3,"But of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the Garden, Elohim said, You shall not eat from it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die."
Genesis,3,4,"The serpent said to the woman, You certainly will not die."
Genesis,3,5,"For [<b>it is revealed before</b>] Elohim (knows) that on the day you will eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will become as gods [<b>great ones</b>], knowing what is good and what is evil."
Genesis,3,6,"The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was tempting [<b>healing</b>] to the eyes, and that the tree was appealing [<b>to look at</b>] as a means of [obtaining] wisdom. She took of its fruit and she ate, and she also gave it to her husband with her, and he ate."
Genesis,3,7,"The eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. They sewed together fig leaves, and made for themselves loincloths."
Genesis,3,8,They heard the voice of [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy Elohim moving in the Garden at the breeze [<b>in the evening</b>] of the day. The man and his wife hid themselves from [the Presence of] Adonoy Elohim among the trees of the Garden.
Genesis,3,9,"Adonoy Elohim called to the man, and He said, Where are you?"
Genesis,3,10,"He said, I heard Your voice [<b>the voice of Your Word</b>] in the Garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself."
Genesis,3,11,"And He said, Who told you that you were naked? From the tree whereof I commanded you not to eat of it, have you eaten?"
Genesis,3,12,"The man said, The woman that You gave to be with me—she gave me of the tree and I ate."
Genesis,3,13,"Adonoy Elohim said to the woman, What is this that you have done? She said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
Genesis,3,14,"Adonoy Elohim said to the serpent, Because you did this, cursed are you from among all animals and beasts of the field. On your belly you shall crawl. And dust you shall eat all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,15,"I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He shall strike you on the head, and you shall strike him on the heel. [<b>He will remember you, what you did to him from the beginning, and you will expect him at the end</b>]."
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman He said, I will greatly increase your sorrow and your pregnancy. You will give birth to children with pain. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will dominate you."
Genesis,3,17,"To the man He said, Because you listened to your wife, and ate from the tree which I commanded you, saying, Do not eat from it; the soil will be cursed because of you. In sorrow [<b>With toil</b>] you shall eat from it all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,18,It will grow thorns and thistles for you; and you will eat the herbs of the field.
Genesis,3,19,"By the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground for from it [the ground] were you taken [<b>created</b>]. For you are dust and to dust you shall return."
Genesis,3,20,"The man called his wife’s name Chavah, [Eve] because she had become the mother of all living [<b>people</b>]."
Genesis,3,21,And Adonoy Elohim made for Adam and his wife leather coats [<b>garments of honor on the skin of their flesh</b>] and He clothed them.
Genesis,3,22,"Adonoy Elohim said, Behold, the man has become like one of us [<b>unique. It is for him</b>] to know [what is] good and [what is] evil. Now he must be prevented from reaching out his hand and also taking from the Tree of Life and eat [from it] and live forever."

Genesis,3,24,"He banished the man [from the Garden] and at the east of [<b>before</b>] the Garden of Eden He stationed the Cherubim and the flame of the rotating sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life."
Genesis,4,1,"The man knew his wife, Chavah. She conceived and she gave birth to Kayin, and she said, I have obtained a man with [<b>the help of</b>] Adonoy."
Genesis,4,2,"She gave birth again, to his brother Hevel. Hevel became a shepherd, but Kayin was a worker of the soil."
Genesis,4,3,"In the course of time, Kayin brought some fruit of the soil as an offering to Adonoy."
Genesis,4,4,"Hevel also brought from the firstborn of his flock, from the best thereof. [<b>There was favor before Adonoy</b>] Adonoy paid regard to Hevel and to his offering."
Genesis,4,5,But to Kayin and his offering He paid no regard [<b>there was no favor</b>]. Kayin became very angry and depressed.
Genesis,4,6,"Adonoy said to Kayin, Why are you angry? Why are you depressed?"
Genesis,4,7,"Is this not so—if you improve [<b>your actions</b>], there is forgiveness [<b>for you</b>], but if you do not improve [<b>your actions</b>], sin rests at the opening [<b>your sin will be kept for the Day of Judgement</b>]. Its desire is unto you, but you can dominate it. [<b>For in the future, it will be exacted from you if you do not repent. And if you repent, there is forgiveness.</b>]"
Genesis,4,8,"Kayin said [something] to his brother Hevel, and it happened when they were in the field, that Kayin rose up against his brother, Hevel, and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Adonoy then said to Kayin, Where is your brother, Hevel? [Kayin] said, I know not, am I my brother’s keeper?"
Genesis,4,10,"He said [to Kayin], What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood [<b>the blood of the descendants that were destined to come from your brother</b>] cries out to [<b>before</b>] Me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,Now you are cursed from the ground that had to open its mouth to accept your brother’s blood from your hand.
Genesis,4,12,"When you work the ground, it will no longer give you of its strength. You will be unsettled, and a wanderer on the earth."
Genesis,4,13,"Kayin said to Adonoy, My sin is too great to bear."
Genesis,4,14,"Behold, today You have banished me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I am to be hidden [<b>from before You it is impossible to be hidden</b>]. I am to be unsettled and a wanderer on the earth; whoever finds me, will kill me."
Genesis,4,15,"Adonoy said to him, Therefore, whoever kills Kayin, [<b>after seven generations</b>] revenge will be taken on him [Kayin] sevenfold. Adonoy placed a mark on Kayin, so that whoever would find him would not kill him."

Genesis,4,23,"Lemech said to his wives, Adah and Tzillah, hear my voice, wives of Lemech listen to my speech; have I have killed a man by my own wounding and a child by my own hurting? [<b>I did not kill a man, that on his account I should bear the sin, and I did not even wound a child, that on his account my seed should be cut off</b>]."
Genesis,4,24,"If Kayin shall be avenged sevenfold [<b>If Kayin’s punishment shall be suspended for seven generations</b>], then for Lemech, his son, it shall be seventy-seven fold [<b>for seventy-seven generations</b>]."

Genesis,17,16,"I will bless her, and I will also give you a son through her. I will bless her, and she will be [a mother] of nations [<i>assemblies</i>], kings of peoples [<i>who rule over nations</i>] will descend from her."
Genesis,17,17,"Avraham fell on his face and laughed [<i>rejoiced</i>]. He said in his heart: Can a hundred year old man have children? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old give birth?"
Genesis,17,18,And Avraham said to [<i>before</i>] Elohim: May it be granted that Yishmael live before You.
Genesis,17,19,"Elohim said: Indeed, your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Yitzchok. I will establish My covenant with him as an eternal covenant to his descendants after him."

Genesis,18,8,"He took butter, milk, and the calf he had prepared, and set it before them. He stood over them [<b>served them</b>] under the tree, and they ate."
Genesis,18,9,"They said to him, Where is Sarah, your wife? He said Here, in the tent."
Genesis,18,10,"He said I will return to you next year [<b>at this time when you will be alive</b>], and Sarah, your wife will have a son. Sarah was listening at the door of the tent, that was behind him."
Genesis,18,11,"Avraham and Sarah were old, well on in years. Sarah no longer had the way of women."
Genesis,18,12,"Sarah laughed to herself saying, Now that I am worn out [<b>old</b>], shall I have the pleasure [of a son] [<b>youthfulness</b>], my master being [also] an old man."
Genesis,18,13,"Adonoy said to Avraham, Why did Sarah laugh saying, Can I really give birth when I am old?"
Genesis,18,14,"Is anything too far removed [<b>hidden</b>] from [<b>before</b>] Adonoy? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time of life [<b>when you will be alive</b>], and Sarah will have a son."
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah denied it saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. He said, Not so, for [<b>but</b>] you did laugh."
Genesis,18,16,"The men stood up from where they were, and they gazed upon Sedom. Avraham went with them to send them [<b>escort them</b>] [on their way]."
Genesis,18,17,"Adonoy said, Shall I conceal from Avraham what I am about to do?"
Genesis,18,18,"Avraham is indeed to become a great and mighty nation, and through him [<b>and because of him</b>] shall be blessed all the nations of the world."
Genesis,18,19,"For I have given him special attention because he commands his children [<b>For it is known to Me that he will command his children</b>], and his household after him, and they will preserve the way of Adonoy [<b>the ways that are good in the eyes of Adonoy</b>], doing charity and justice, so that Adonoy will bring upon Avraham all that which He has spoken of him."
Genesis,18,20,"[Thus] Adonoy said, The wailing concerning Sedom and Amorah is so great, and their sin is so very grave."
Genesis,18,21,"I will descend now and see [<b>I will become revealed now and judge</b>], if their wailing which has come to [<b>before</b>] Me is indicative of their conduct; destruction [shall come upon them] [<b>I will destroy them</b>]. If not I will know. [<b>If they will repent, I will not punish them.</b>]"
Genesis,18,22,"The men turned from where they were, and went toward Sedom. Avraham was still standing [<b>serving with prayer</b>] before Adonoy."
Genesis,18,23,"Avraham came forward and said, Will You [actually] destroy the righteous with the wicked [<b>in anger</b>]?"
Genesis,18,24,"Suppose [<b>Perhaps</b>] there are fifty righteous people in the midst of the city, will You still destroy it [<b>in anger</b>], and not bear with the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people inside it?"
Genesis,18,25,"It would be sacrilege [<b>Your judgments are true therefore it is impossible</b>] [to attribute] to You such an act, to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. It would be sacrilege to attribute this to You [<b>Your judgments are true</b>]: Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?"
Genesis,18,26,"Adonoy said; If, in Sedom, I find fifty righteous within the city, I will bear with the entire place for their sake."
Genesis,18,27,"Avraham responded and said, Here I have begun to speak to [<b>before</b>] my Master, and I am but dust and ashes."
Genesis,18,28,"But suppose [<b>perhaps</b>] they lack five of the fifty righteous? Will You destroy all the city because of five? He said, I will not destroy if I find forty-five there."
Genesis,18,29,"He [Avraham] continued to speak to [<b>before</b>] Him and said, Suppose [<b>Perhaps</b>] there are forty found there? He said, I will not do it [<b>inflict destruction</b>] for the sake of the forty."
Genesis,18,30,"He said, Let not my Master show anger and I will [continue] to speak. Suppose [<b>Perhaps</b>] thirty are found there? He said, I will not do it [<b>inflict destruction</b>] if I find thirty there."
Genesis,18,31,"He said, Here I wished to speak to [<b>before</b>] my Master. Suppose [<b>Perhaps</b>] twenty are found there? He said, I will not destroy for the sake of the twenty."
Genesis,18,32,"He said, Let not my Master show anger [<b>Let there not be anger before my Master</b>], and I will speak just once more. Suppose [<b>Perhaps</b>] ten are found there? He said, I will not destroy for the sake of the ten."
Genesis,18,33,"Adonoy departed [<b>The glory of Adonoy ascended</b>] when He finished speaking to Avraham, and Avraham returned to his place."
Genesis,19,1,"The two angels came to Sedom in the evening, while Lot was sitting at the gate of Sedom. Lot saw them, and he got up to greet them, and he bowed with his face to the ground."
Genesis,19,2,"He said, Behold [<b>Please</b>] now my lords, please [<b>now</b>] turn in to your servant’s house. Stay over night, bathe your feet, and get up early and continue on your way. They said, No, we will spend the night in the street."
Genesis,19,3,"He urged them greatly, and they turned in to him and came to his house. He made a feast for them, and baked matzos [<b>for them</b>], and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"They had not yet lain down when the men of the city, the men of Sedom, surrounded the house—young and old alike—all the people from one end [of the city] to the other end."
Genesis,19,5,"They called to Lot and said to him, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them."
Genesis,19,6,"Lot went out to them in front of the entrance, shutting the door behind him."
Genesis,19,7,"He said, My brothers, please [<b>now</b>] do not act wickedly."
Genesis,19,8,"Behold! I have two daughters who have never known a man, I will bring them out to you, and do with them as you please; only do nothing to these men, since after all, they came under the shelter of my roof."
Genesis,19,9,"They said, Step back out of the way! They said, This one came as an immigrant, and now he wants to be a judge. We will now deal worse with you than with them. They pushed hard against Lot, and came near to break the door."
Genesis,19,10,"The men put out their hands, and pulled Lot to them, into the house, and closed the door."
Genesis,19,11,"The men who were at the entrance of the house, they struck with blindness—young and old alike—so that they wearied themselves trying to find the entrance."
Genesis,19,12,"The men said to Lot, Who else do you have here—a son-in-law, your sons, your daughters? Whoever you have in the city, bring them out of his place."
Genesis,19,13,"We are going to destroy this place, for the wailing concerning them has become great in the presence of Adonoy; and Adonoy has sent us to destroy it."
Genesis,19,14,"Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who had married his daughters. He said [to them], Get up! Get out of this place, for Adonoy is going to destroy the city! He appeared as a comedian in the eyes of his sons-in-law."
Genesis,19,15,"At the break of dawn, the angels urged Lot on, saying, Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here [<b>who are found to be faithful to you</b>], lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city."
Genesis,19,16,"He hesitated, and the men grabbed his hand and the hand of his wife and two daughters, for Adonoy had pity on him. They brought him out and placed him outside the city."
Genesis,19,17,"When they were brought out [of the city], he [the angel] said, Escape [<b>Have pity</b>] for your life! Do not look back! Do not remain anywhere in the valley [<b>plain</b>]. Escape to the mountain, lest you be swept away."
Genesis,19,18,"Lot said to them, Please, not so my Master. [<b>Please, now, my Master.</b>]"
Genesis,19,19,"Behold your servant has found favor in Your eyes [<b>before You</b>]. Great is your kindness [<b>goodness</b>] that you have done with me, to keep me alive. I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the evil attach itself to me and I die."
Genesis,19,20,"Behold, please, this city is near [enough] to flee there. It is insignificant. Let me escape there! It is insignificant, and my life will be saved."
Genesis,19,21,"He said to him, See I have also given you consideration regarding this. I will not overturn the city that you mentioned [<b>for which you have beseeched</b>]."
Genesis,19,22,"Hurry, escape there, for I can do nothing until you get there. The city was therefore called Zoar."
Genesis,19,23,"The sun had risen upon the earth, when Lot came to Zoar."
Genesis,19,24,"Adonoy caused to rain upon Sedom and Amorah—sulfur and fire—from [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, from heaven."

Genesis,19,30,"Lot went up from Zoar and lived in the mountain; and his two daughters went with him, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave, he and his two daughters."
Genesis,19,31,"The older girl said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man [left] on earth who will come into us in the normal manner."
Genesis,19,32,"Come let us urge our father to drink wine, and sleep with him; that we may give life to seed [children] from our father."
Genesis,19,33,They urged wine upon their father that night; and the older girl went in and slept with her father. He was not aware that she lay down or got up.
Genesis,19,34,"The next day, the older girl said to the younger, Last night I slept with my father. Let us urge wine upon him tonight also, and you go in and sleep with him that we may give life to seed from our father."

Genesis,20,3,"Elohim came to Avimelech [<b>Word came from before Elohim to Avimelech</b>] in a dream at night, and said to him, Behold, you shall die because of the woman you took, for she is a married woman [<b>a man’s wife</b>]."
Genesis,20,4,"Avimelech had not come near to her. He said, My Master, will You also kill an innocent nation?"
Genesis,20,5,"Did he not say to me, She is my sister? And she also said, He is my brother. With an innocent [<b>upright</b>] heart and clean [<b>righteous</b>] hands I did this."
Genesis,20,6,"Elohim said to him [<b>Word from Elohim was said to him</b>] in a dream, I also know [<b>it is also revealed before me</b>] that you did this with an innocent [<b>upright</b>] heart. I also prevented you from sinning against [<b>before</b>] Me. That is why I did not give you the chance to touch her."

Genesis,20,8,"Avimelech got up early in the morning, and called all his servants. He spoke all these words in their ears [<b>before them</b>], and the men were very frightened."
Genesis,20,9,"Avimelech called Avraham and said to him, What have you done to us? What wrong did I do to you that you brought on me and upon my kingdom such a great sin? Deeds that ought not to be done, you have done to me."
Genesis,20,10,"Avimelech [then] said to Avraham, What did you see that you did such a thing?"
Genesis,20,11,"Avraham said, Because I said [thought] there is no fear of Elohim in this place, and they will kill me [in order] to take my wife."
Genesis,20,12,"In any case, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"When Elohim caused me to wander from my father’s house [<b>When the nations strayed after the works of their hands, Elohim brought me close to His worship from my father’s house</b>], I said to her, this is the kindness [<b>goodness</b>] you shall do for me. At every place we come [<b>go</b>] to, say of me, He is my brother."
Genesis,20,14,"Avimelech took sheep, cattle, male and female slaves, and he gave them to Avraham. He [also] returned his wife Sarah to him."
Genesis,20,15,"Avimelech said, Behold, my land is before you. Live wherever you see fit."
Genesis,20,16,"To Sarah, he said, Behold I have given to your brother a thousand pieces [<b>shekalim</b>] of silver. It will be for you a [compensational] eye covering for all who are with you, that you may face every one.

Genesis,21,8,The child grew and was weaned. Avraham made a great feast on the day Yitzchok was weaned.
Genesis,21,9,"Sarah saw that the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, that she had born to Avraham, was mocking."

Genesis,21,11,"This thing was very wrong in the eyes of Avraham, on account of his son."
Genesis,21,12,"Elohim said to Avraham, Do not consider this wrong in your eyes on account of the boy and your slave-woman. Regarding all that Sarah tells you, listen to her voice [<b>accept from her</b>], for [only] through Yitzchok will seed be considered yours."
Genesis,21,13,"[But] also the son of the slave-woman I will make into a nation, for he is [of] your seed."
Genesis,21,14,"Avraham got up early in the morning. He took bread and a skin [pouch] of water, and gave it to Hagar. He placed it on her shoulder with the lad, and sent her away. She went and lost her way in the desert of Beer Sheva."
Genesis,21,15,"The water in the skin was used up, and she threw the lad under one of the bushes."
Genesis,21,16,"She went and sat facing him, about [the distance] of bow-shots away. She said, Let me not see the lad die. She sat facing him and wept in a loud voice."
Genesis,21,17,"Elohim heard the voice of the lad [<b>was heard before Elohim</b>]. An angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, What is the matter, Hagar? Do not fear. Elohim has heard the voice of the lad [<b>has been heard before Elohim</b>] in the place where he is."
Genesis,21,18,"Get up and lift up the lad. Keep your hand strong on him, for I will make him a great nation."
Genesis,21,19,"Elohim opened [<b>uncovered</b>] her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink."
Genesis,21,20,"Elohim was with the lad [<b>The Word of Elohim supported the lad</b>] and he grew up. He settled in the wilderness, [where] he became an expert archer."
Genesis,21,21,"He lived in the desert of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt."
Genesis,21,22,"It was at this time, Avimelech and Pichol, his general spoke to Avraham, saying, Elohim is with you in all that you do [<b>the Word of Elohim is your support in all that you do</b>]."
Genesis,21,23,"Now, swear to me here, by [<b>the Word of</b>] Elohim, that you will not deal falsely with me, with my son, or my grandson. The kindness [<b>goodness</b>] that I have done to you, do to me and to the land in which you lived for a while."
Genesis,21,24,"Avraham said, I will swear."
Genesis,21,25,Avraham then reprimanded Avimelech regarding the well of water that Avimelech’s servants had taken by force.
Genesis,21,26,"Avimelech said, I do not know who did this thing. You also never told me, and I also heard nothing of it until today."
Genesis,21,27,Avraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Avimelech. The two of them made a covenant.
Genesis,21,28,Avraham set seven ewes apart by themselves.
Genesis,21,29,Avimelech said to Avraham. What is the reason for these seven ewes that you have set apart?
Genesis,21,30,"He [Avraham] said, Take these seven ewes from my hand so that it will be proof for me, that I dug this well."
Genesis,21,31,"Therefore he called that place Beer Sheva, since the two had made an oath there."
Genesis,21,32,"They made a covenant in Beer Sheva. Avimelech, and Pichol, his general, then rose and returned to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"Avraham planted an <i>eishel</i> [tree] in Beer Sheva, and there he proclaimed [<b>and there he prayed in</b>] the Name Adonoy, Almighty of the universe."

Genesis,22,1,"After these events, Elohim tested Avraham and said to him, Avraham! and he [Avraham] said, Here I am."
Genesis,22,2,"He said, Please [<b>Now</b>] take your son, your only one, who you love—Yitzchok—and go to the land of Moriah [<b>worship</b>]. Sacrifice him [<b>before me</b>] as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will designate to you."
Genesis,22,3,"Avraham awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two assistants with him, and also his son, Yitzchok. He split the wood of the burnt-offering, rose, and went to the place that Elohim had designated to him."
Genesis,22,4,"On the third day, Avraham raised his eyes and saw the place from afar."
Genesis,22,5,"Avraham said to his assistants, Remain here with the donkey and I and the lad will go to that place. We will prostrate ourselves [in worship] and return to you."
Genesis,22,6,"Avraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and placed it on his son Yitzchok. In his hand he took the fire and the knife, and they both went together."
Genesis,22,7,"Yitzchok spoke to Avraham, his father, and said, Father, and he [Avraham] said, Here I am, my son. He said, Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?"
Genesis,22,8,"Avraham said, Elohim will show the lamb [<b>the lamb is revealed before Elohim</b>] for a burnt-offering, my son. And the two of them went together."
Genesis,22,9,"They came to the place that Elohim had designated to him. Avraham built the altar there, and arranged the wood. He bound his son Yitzchok, and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood."
Genesis,22,10,Avraham extended his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
Genesis,22,11,"An angel of Adonoy called to him from heaven and said, Avraham, Avraham! and he said, Here I am."
Genesis,22,12,"He [God] said, Do not touch the lad, nor do anything to [harm] him; for now I know that you are one who fears Elohim and have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me."
Genesis,22,13,Avraham looked up [<b>afterwards</b>] and beheld a ram after it had been caught in the thicket by its horns. Avraham went and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt-offering instead of his son.
Genesis,22,14,"Avraham called the name of that place, Adonoy will see; as it is said [to] this day, On Adonoy’s mountain, He will be seen. [<b>Avraham worshiped and prayed there in that place, and he said before Adonoy, “Here will generations worship”. Therefore, as it is said [to] this day, “On this mountain Avraham worshiped before Adonoy”.</b>]"
Genesis,22,15,"An angel of Adonoy called to Avraham, a second time, from heaven."
Genesis,22,16,"And said, I have sworn by Myself [<b>My Word</b>], declares Adonoy, that because you performed this deed, and did not withhold your only son."
Genesis,22,17,I will greatly bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars of the sky and like the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will inherit the gate [<b>cities</b>] of their enemies.
Genesis,22,18,"Through [<b>Because of</b>] your children, will be blessed all the nations of the world, because you heeded My voice [<b>Word</b>]."
Genesis,22,19,"Avraham returned to his assistants, and they rose and went together to Beer Sheva. Avraham dwelt in Beer Sheva."

Genesis,24,27,"He said, Blessed is Adonoy, God of my master, Avraham, Who has not abandoned His kindness [<b>goodness</b>] and truth [in dealing] with my master. I am still on the [<b>straight</b>] road and Adonoy has led me to the house of my master’s brethren."

Genesis,24,33,"Food was set before him, but he said, I will not eat until I have spoken my words. He replied, Speak."

Genesis,24,38,"Instead, you must go to my father’s house, and to my family. Take a wife for my son."
Genesis,24,39,"I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not come back with me?"
Genesis,24,40,"He said to me, Adonoy, before Whom I have walked [<b>worshiped</b>], will send His angel with you, and make your journey successful. You will then take a wife for my son from my family and from my fathers house."
Genesis,24,41,"You will then be absolved from my oath, if when you come [<b>go</b>] to my family, and they will not give her to you. You will be absolved from my oath."

Genesis,24,45,"Before I had finished speaking thus in my heart, when suddenly Rivkah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the well and drew water; and I said to her, Please [<b>Now</b>] give me a drink,"
Genesis,24,46,"She quickly lowered her pitcher and said, Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink. I drank and she also gave the camels to drink."
Genesis,24,47,"I asked her and said, Whose daughter are you? She replied, The daughter of Besueil, son of Nachor, whom Milkah bore unto him. I [then] placed a nose ring on her face and bracelets upon her hands."
Genesis,24,48,"I bowed and prostrated myself to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, and I blessed Adonoy, God of my master Avraham, Who led me on the true path [in order] to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son."
Genesis,24,49,"Now if you want to do what is kind [<b>good</b>] and true to my master, tell me. If not, tell me, and I will turn to the right or to the left."
Genesis,24,50,"Lavan and Besueil answered and said, This is from [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, we cannot say anything to you, bad or good."
Genesis,24,51,"Here, Rivkah is before you, take her and go. Let her be a wife to your master’s son, as Adonoy has spoken."
Genesis,24,52,"When Avraham’s servant heard their words, he prostrated himself to the ground to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."
Genesis,24,53,"The servant took out articles of silver, articles of gold and garments, and gave them to Rivkah. To her brother and mother, he gave precious fruits."
Genesis,24,54,"They [then] ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and they stayed over night. They got up in the morning and he said, Send me off to my master."

Genesis,24,57,"They said, Let us call the girl and ask her [<b>and hear what she says</b>]."
Genesis,24,58,"They called Rivkah and said to her, Will you go with this man? She said, I will go."
Genesis,24,59,"They sent off Rivkah their sister, along with her nurse, and with Avraham’s servant and his men."
Genesis,24,60,"They blessed Rivkah and said to her, Our sister, may you become thousands of [<b>and</b>] myriads, and may your descendants inherit the gate [<b>cities</b>] of his foes."
Genesis,24,61,Rivkah and her maidens set off. They rode on the camels and followed the man. The servant took Rivkah and left.
Genesis,24,62,"Yitzchok had just come from the well [called] Lachai Ro’i [<b>the well at which a living angel appeared</b>], for he lived in the land of the Negev [<b>south</b>]."
Genesis,24,63,Yitzchok went out to meditate [<b>pray</b>] in the field towards evening. He raised his eyes and suddenly saw camels approaching.
Genesis,24,64,Rivkah raised her eyes and saw Yitzchok. She let herself down from [<b>She inclined herself while upon</b>] the camel.
Genesis,24,65,"She said to the servant, Who is that man walking through the field towards us? The servant said, He is my master. She then took the veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,The servant told Yitzchok all the things he had done.
Genesis,24,67,"Yitzchok brought her into the tent of his mother, Sarah. [<b>Yitzchok brought her into the tent, and behold, her deeds were good like the deeds of Sarah his mother.</b>] He married Rivkah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. Yitzchok was then consoled for the loss of his mother."
Genesis,25,1,Avraham again took a wife. Her name was Keturah.
Genesis,25,2,"She bore him Zimran, Yokshon, Medan, Midian, Yishbok, and Shuach."
Genesis,25,3,"Yokshon fathered Shevah and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Ashurim [<b>those who dwell in camps</b>], Letushim [<b>those who dwell in tents</b>] and Leumim [<b>those who dwell on islands</b>]."
Genesis,25,4,"The sons of Midian were Eiphah, Eipher, Chanoch, Avidah and Eldoah. All these were children of Keturah."
Genesis,25,5,Avraham gave all that he possessed to Yitzchok.
Genesis,25,6,"To the sons of the concubines that Avraham had, Avraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Yitzchok, his son, while he [Avraham] was still alive. [He sent them] eastward to the Land of the East."
Genesis,25,7,"These are the days of the years of Avraham which he lived, one hundred years, seventy years and five years."
Genesis,25,8,"Avraham expired and died in a good old age, old and satisfied [<b>and in the fullness of days</b>], and he was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,9,"His sons Yitzchok and Yishmael buried him in the Machpeilah cave, in the field of Ephron, son of Tzochar, the Chitite, which faces Mamrei."
Genesis,25,10,"[This was] the field that Avraham purchased from the sons of Cheis. Avraham and his wife, Sarah, were buried there."
Genesis,25,11,"After Avraham died, Elohim blessed his son Yitzchok. Yitzchok lived near Be’er Lachai Ro’i [<b>the well at which a living angel appeared</b>]."
Genesis,25,12,"These are the descendants of Yishmael son of Avraham, whom Hagar, the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave, bore to Avraham."
Genesis,25,13,"These are the names of Yishmael’s sons, by their names according to their birth. Nevayos was Yishmael’s first born, [he also had] Keidar, Adbeil and Mivsom,"
Genesis,25,14,"Mishma, Dumah and Masa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Chadad, Teima, Yetur, Nofish and Keidmah."

Genesis,25,18,"They lived from Chavilah to Shur [<b>Chagar</b>], which borders on Egypt, going towards Asshur. He lived in the presence of all his brethren."
Genesis,25,19,And these are the descendants of Yitzchok son of Avraham. Avraham was the father of Yitzchok.
Genesis,25,20,"Yitzchok was forty years old when he took Rivkah, the daughter of Besueil, the Aramite, of Padan Aram, sister of Lavan, the Aramite, for a wife."
Genesis,25,21,"Yitzchok prayed to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy across from [<b>opposite</b>] his wife, for she was barren. Adonoy granted his prayer and his wife, Rivkah, conceived."
Genesis,25,22,"The children clashed [<b>pressed</b>] inside her, and [when this happened] she said, If this is so, why did I desire this? She [then] went to inquire of [<b>to ask for instruction from before</b>] Adonoy."
Genesis,25,23,"Adonoy said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two Kingdoms will separate from within you. One government will be mightier than the other, but the greater one will serve the smaller one."
Genesis,25,24,"When her days of pregnancy were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,"The first one came out with a reddish complexion, covered completely with what was like a hairy robe, and they named him Eisov."
Genesis,25,26,"After that his brother came out, his hand grasping the heel of Eisov, and he [Yitzchok] named him Yaakov. Yitzchok was sixty years old when she [Rivkah] gave birth to them."
Genesis,25,27,"The lads grew up. Eisov became a skilled trapper [<b>an idle man</b>], a man of the field [<b>a man going out to the field</b>]. Yaakov was a wholesome man, living in tents [<b>serving in the house of study</b>]."
Genesis,25,28,"Yitzchok loved Eisov because he ate of his trappings, but Rivkah loved Yaakov."
Genesis,25,29,"Yaakov was simmering a pottage when Eisov came in from the field, exhausted."
Genesis,25,30,"Eisov said to Yaakov, Please [<b>Now</b>] give me a swallow of this red [pottage], for I am exhausted. He was therefore named Edom [Red]."
Genesis,25,31,"Yaakov said, As of this day [<b>Like this day</b>], sell your birthright to me."
Genesis,25,32,"Eisov said, Here I am going to die, what [good] is this birthright to me."
Genesis,25,33,"Yaakov said, Swear to me as of this day [<b>like this day</b>]. He swore to him, and sold his birthright to Yaakov."
Genesis,25,34,"Yaakov then gave Eisov bread and a pottage of lentils. He [Eisov] ate and drank, got up and left. [Thus] Eisov scorned the birthright."
Genesis,26,1,"There was a famine in the land, aside from the first famine that was in the days of Avraham. Yitzchok went to Avimelech, king of the Philistines, in Gerar."
Genesis,26,2,"Adonoy appeared [<b>became revealed</b>] to him and said, Do not go down to Egypt. Settle in the land that I will make known to you."
Genesis,26,3,"Stay temporarily in this land and I will be with you and bless you [<b>My Word will be your support and I will bless you</b>], for to you and your descendants I will give all these lands. I will [thus] keep the oath that I swore to Avraham, your father."
Genesis,26,4,"I will make your descendants [as numerous] as the stars of the heavens, and I will give your descendants all these lands. Through [<b>Because of</b>] your descendants shall be blessed all the nations of the world."
Genesis,26,5,"[All this is] because Avraham listened to [<b>accepted</b>] My voice [<b>Word</b>], and minded My mandate [<b>the mandate of My Word</b>], My commandments, My decrees and My teachings."
Genesis,26,6,Yitzchok [thus] settled in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,"The local men asked about his wife, and he said, She is my sister. He was afraid to say, [she is] my wife, lest the local men kill me for Rivkah, for she is so good looking."
Genesis,26,8,"Once, after [Yitzchok] had been there a long while, Avimelech, king of the Philistines, looked at the window, and he saw, and behold, Yitzchok was amusing himself with Rivkah, his wife."
Genesis,26,9,"Avimelech called Yitzchok and he said, But she is your wife. How could you have said, She is my sister? Yitzchok said to him, Because I said, I might die because of her."
Genesis,26,10,"Avimelech said, What have you done to us? One of the people [<b>The unique one among the people</b>] could have easily slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
Genesis,26,11,"Avimelech [then] commanded all his people, saying, Whoever touches [<b>injures</b>] this man or his wife, shall die."
Genesis,26,12,"Yitzchok planted in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundred fold [<b>more than that which they estimated</b>], for Adonoy had blessed him."
Genesis,26,13,The man prospered. He continued to prosper [<b>and increase</b>] until he became very great.
Genesis,26,14,"He owned flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and many slaves, and the Philistines were jealous of him."
Genesis,26,15,"All the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father, Avraham—the Philistines plugged them, and filled them with earth."
Genesis,26,16,"Avimelech said to Yitzchok, Go away from us. You have become much more powerful than us."
Genesis,26,17,Yitzchok went away from there. He camped in the valley of Gerar and settled there.
Genesis,26,18,"Yitzchok returned and excavated the wells of water which were dug in the days of his father, Avraham, and were plugged by the Philistines after Avraham’s death. He gave them the same names that his father had given them."
Genesis,26,19,Yitzchok’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring [<b>flowing</b>] water.
Genesis,26,20,"The shepherds of Gerar argued with the shepherds of Yitzchok, saying, the water is ours. He named the well Eisek [Quarrel], because they had quarreled with him."
Genesis,26,21,They dug another well and they also argued about it. He named the well Sitnah [Obstruction].
Genesis,26,22,"He moved away from there and he dug another well, and there was no argument over it. He named it Rechovos [Wide Spaces], and said, For now Adonoy has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
Genesis,26,23,From there he went to Beer Sheva.
Genesis,26,24,"Adonoy appeared [<b>became revealed</b>] to him that night and said, I am the God of your father, Avraham. Do not fear for I am with you [<b>My Word is your support</b>]. I will bless you and make your descendants numerous, because of My servant, Avraham."
Genesis,26,25,"He [Yitzchok] built an altar there, and proclaimed [<b>prayed in</b>] the Name of Adonoy. He set up his tent there, and Yitzchok’s servants dug a well there."
Genesis,26,26,"Avimelech came to Yitzchok from Gerar along with a group of friends and Pichol, his general."
Genesis,26,27,"Yitzchok said to them, Why have you come to me? You hate me and drove me away from you."
Genesis,26,28,"They said, We have indeed seen that Adonoy is with you [<b>the Word of Adonoy is your support</b>], and we said, Let there now be an oath between us, [<b>Let the oath that was between our fathers now be established</b>] between ourselves and you, and let us make a covenant with you;"
Genesis,26,29,"that you will do us no harm, just as we did not touch [<b>injure</b>] you. We did nothing but good to you, and sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed one of Adonoy."
Genesis,26,30,"He [Yitzchok] made a feast for them, and they ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"They got up early in the morning, and they each swore to the other. Yitzchok sent them away and they left in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"On that day Yitzchok’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug; and they said to him, We have found water."
Genesis,26,33,He named it Shiva. Therefore the city is called Beer Sheva until this very day.
Genesis,26,34,"Eisov was forty years old and he married Yehudis, the daughter of Be’eri, the Chittite and Bosmas, the daughter of Eylon the Chittite."
Genesis,26,35,They were rebellious of spirit to [<b>They were rebels and aggravators against the words of</b>] Yitzchok and Rivkah.
Genesis,27,1,"And when Yitzchok grew old his eyesight faded and he could not see. He called Eisov, his elder son, and said to him, My son. [Eisov] said to him, Here I am."
Genesis,27,2,"[Yitzchok] said, Behold, if you please [<b>now</b>], I am old. I do not know the day of my death."
Genesis,27,3,"Now [therefore] please [<b>now</b>] take your equipment, your sword and your bow, and go out to the field and trap [deer] for me."
Genesis,27,4,"Make it into a tasty dish for me, the way I like it, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul will bless you before I die."
Genesis,27,5,"Rivkah had [over]heard what Yitzchok said to his son, Eisov. Eisov went out to the field to trap [deer] to bring it [home.]"
Genesis,27,6,"Rivkah said to her son Yaakov, saying, Behold, I heard your father speaking to your brother Eisov, saying,"
Genesis,27,7,Bring back [deer] for me and make it into a tasty dish for me and I will eat. I will then bless you in the presence of Adonoy before I die.
Genesis,27,8,"Now my son, listen to [<b>accept</b>] me, concerning that which I command you."
Genesis,27,9,"Go, please [<b>now</b>], to the sheep and take for me from there two choice young goats, and I will make [from] them a tasty dish for your father as he likes."
Genesis,27,10,"You will [then] bring it to your father to eat, in order that he will bless you before he dies."
Genesis,27,11,"Yaakov said to Rivkah, his mother, Behold, Eisov, my brother is a hairy person and I am a smooth-skinned person."
Genesis,27,12,Suppose my father touches me. I will be in his eyes as an impostor [<b>a mocker</b>]. I will bring upon myself a curse [<b>curses</b>]—not a blessing [<b>blessings</b>].
Genesis,27,13,"His mother said to him, Your curse shall be upon me [<b>It was said regarding me in a prophecy that curses will not come upon you</b>], my son; but listen to [<b>accept</b>] me. Go bring them to me."
Genesis,27,14,"He went, took [them], and brought [them] to his mother. His mother make a tasty dish as his father liked."
Genesis,27,15,"Rivkah took the garments of Eisov, her elder son, [the garments] that were precious [to him] [<b>the clean ones</b>] that were in her keeping in the house, and put them on Yaakov, her younger son."
Genesis,27,16,The skins of the young goats she placed on his hands and the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,"She placed the tasty dish and the bread which she had made, in the hand of Yaakov, her son."
Genesis,27,18,"He came to his father and said, My father. [Yitzchok] said, Here I am. Who are you my son?"
Genesis,27,19,"Yaakov said to his father, It is I, Eisov your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Rise, if you please [<b>now</b>], sit up [<b>recline</b>] and eat of my trapping so that your soul will bless me."
Genesis,27,20,"Yitzchok said to his son, How is it that you found it so quickly my son? He [Yaakov] said, Because Adonoy, your God, brought it about for me."
Genesis,27,21,"Yitzchok said to Yaakov, Come close, if you please [<b>now</b>], and let me touch you, my son. Are you my son Eisov or not?"
Genesis,27,22,"Yaakov came close to Yitzchok, his father, and he [Yitzchok] touched him. He said, The voice is the voice of Yaakov, but the hands are the hands of Eisov."
Genesis,27,23,"He [Yitzchok] did not recognize him because his hands were like those of Eisov, his brother—they were hairy—and [thus] he blessed him."
Genesis,27,24,"He said, Are you indeed my son, Eisov? [Yaakov] said, [<b>Behold</b>] I am."
Genesis,27,25,"He said, Bring it close to [<b>before</b>] me and I will eat from my son’s trappings, so that my soul will bless you. He brought it close to him and he ate. He [then] brought him wine and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"His father Yitzchok said to him, Come close to me [<b>now</b>] and kiss me, my son."
Genesis,27,27,"He came close and kissed him. He [Yitzchok] smelled the fragrance of his garments, and he blessed him. He said, See, my son’s fragrance is like the fragrance of a field blessed by Adonoy."
Genesis,27,28,"And may God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness [riches] [<b>goodness</b>] of the land, and abundance of grain and wine."
Genesis,27,29,"Peoples will serve you and nations bow to you [<b>kingdoms will be subservient to you</b>]. Be master over your brothers, and your mother’s sons will bow to you. Those who curse you are [<b>will be</b>] cursed, and those who bless you are [<b>will be</b>] blessed."
Genesis,27,30,"It was when Yitzchok had finished blessing Yaakov, and Yaakov had just left the presence of Yitzchok, his father, that Eisov came back from his trapping."
Genesis,27,31,"He too made a tasty dish and brought it to his father. He said to his father, Let my father rise and eat of his son’s trapping, that your soul may bless me."
Genesis,27,32,"Yitzchok, his father, said to him, Who are you? He said, I am your son, your firstborn, Eisov."
Genesis,27,33,"Yitzchok was seized with a powerful trembling [<b>Yitzchok was astonished with great astonishment</b>]; and said, Who, then, is he who trapped [deer] and brought it to me. I ate all of it before you came, and I blessed him. He shall be blessed."
Genesis,27,34,"When Eisov heard his father’s words, he wailed a most loud and bitter cry, and he said to his father, Bless me too, my father."
Genesis,27,35,"[Yitzchok] said, Your brother came with cunning [<b>wisdom</b>] and he took [<b>received</b>] your blessing."
Genesis,27,36,"[Eisov] said, Is he not rightly called Yaakov? [<b>He is rightly called Yaakov</b>] He has deceived me twice; he took my birthright, and now he has taken [<b>received</b>] my blessing. He said, Have you not saved a blessing for me?"
Genesis,27,37,"Yitzchok replied and said to Eisov. Behold, I have made him your master, and all his brothers I have given him as slaves. I have sustained him with grain and wine. Where? [<b>Here.</b>] What can I do for you, my son?"
Genesis,27,38,"Eisov said to his father, Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father, and Eisov raised his voice and wept."
Genesis,27,39,"Yitzchok, his father replied and said to him, Behold the fatness [richness] [<b>goodness</b>] of the earth shall be your dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above."
Genesis,27,40,"You shall live by your sword, and you shall serve your brother. When you have cause to be grieved [<b>When his sons will transgress the words of the Torah</b>], you will throw off his yoke from your neck."
Genesis,27,41,"Eisov hated Yaakov because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Eisov said in his heart, The mourning days for my father are approaching. I will then kill my brother, Yaakov."
Genesis,27,42,"Rivkah was informed about the words of Eisov, her older son, and she sent [a messenger] to call Yaakov, her younger son, and she said to him. Behold, your brother Eisov is consoled through you [<b>lying in wait for you</b>], [for he intends] to kill you."
Genesis,27,43,"Now my son listen to [<b>accept</b>] me. Get up and flee to Lavan, my brother, to Charan."
Genesis,27,44,Remain with him a short time until your brother’s fury has subsided.
Genesis,27,45,"Until your brother’s rage toward you has subsided, and he has forgotten what you did to him. I will then send [for you] and bring you [back] from there. Why should I lose both of you on one day?"
Genesis,27,46,"Rivkah said to Yitzchok, I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Cheis. If Yaakov marries a woman of the daughters of Cheis, like these, from the daughters of the land, what is life [worth] to me."
Genesis,28,1,"Yitzchok called Yaakov and blessed him. He commanded him and said to him, Do not marry a woman of the daughters of Canaan."
Genesis,28,2,"Set out and go to Padan Aram, to the house of Besueil, your mother’s father, and marry one of the daughters of Lavan, your mother’s brother."
Genesis,28,3,"May the Almighty, Shaddai, bless you, make you fruitful and multiply you. May you become an assembly of peoples [<b>tribes</b>]."
Genesis,28,4,"May He give you the blessing of Avraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may inherit the land of your dwelling which God gave to Avraham."
Genesis,28,5,"Yitzchok sent Yaakov on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Lavan, son of Besueil the Aramean, the brother of Rivkah, mother of Yaakov and Eisov."
Genesis,28,6,"Eisov saw that Yitzchok blessed Yaakov, and sent him to Paddan Aram, to find a wife there; and as he blessed him, he commanded him saying, Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan."
Genesis,28,7,"And Yaakov listened to [<b>accepted</b>] his father and mother, and went to Paddan Aram."
Genesis,28,8,"Eisov [thus] realized that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Yitzchok, his father."
Genesis,28,9,"Eisov [then] went to Yishmael, and took Mochalas, the daughter of Yishmael, the son of Avraham and sister of Nevayos, in addition to his other wives, for a wife."
Genesis,28,10,Yaakov left Beer Sheva and went toward Charan.
Genesis,28,11,"He reached the place and spent the night there because the sun had set. He took some of the stones of that place, and arranged them around his head, and lay down [to sleep] in that place."
Genesis,28,12,"He dreamed, and behold a ladder was set up on [<b>planted in</b>] the earth and the top of it reached toward heaven; and behold angels of Elohim were ascending and descending on it."
Genesis,28,13,"And behold [<b>the Glory of</b>] Adonoy stood over him, and said, I am Adonoy, God of Avraham, your father, and God of Yitzchok. The land upon which you are lying, I will give to you and to your descendants."
Genesis,28,14,"Your descendants shall be [<b>many</b>] as the dust of the earth. You shall spread [<b>be strong</b>] to the west, to the east, to the north and to the south. Through [<b>Because of</b>] you shall be blessed all the families of the earth, and through [<b>because of</b>] your descendants."
Genesis,28,15,"Behold, I am with you [<b>My Word is your support</b>], and I will guard you wherever [<b>every place</b>] you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not forsake you until I have done that which I have spoken for you."
Genesis,28,16,"Yaakov awoke from his sleep, and said, In truth, [<b>the Glory of</b>] Adonoy is [<b>dwells</b>] in this place, and I did not know it [<b>would not have known it</b>]."
Genesis,28,17,"He was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of Elohim [<b>not a regular place but a place where it is the will of Elohim to receive prayers</b>], and this is the gate of [<b>opposite</b>] heaven."
Genesis,28,18,"Yaakov rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had placed at his head; and he set it as a monument, and poured oil on its top."
Genesis,28,19,"He named that place Beis Eil, but Luz was the original name of the city."
Genesis,28,20,"Yaakov made a vow, saying, If [<b>the Word of</b>] Elohim will be with me [<b>my support</b>], and guards me on this path that I am going, and gives me bread to eat and clothing to wear;"
Genesis,28,21,"And if I return in peace to my father’s house, and [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy will be my God;"
Genesis,28,22,"[Then] this stone which I have set [as] a monument will become a House of God [<b>place where I will worship upon it before God</b>], and of all that You give, I will surely give a tenth to [<b>before</b>] You."
Genesis,29,1,Yaakov [then] lifted his feet and went toward the land of the people of the East.
Genesis,29,2,"He looked and [saw] a well in the field; and behold there were three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for from that well the flocks are watered. There was a large stone over the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,3,"When all the flocks would gather, [the shepherds] would roll the stone from the well’s mouth, and water the sheep. They would [then] return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,4,"Yaakov said to them, My brothers, from where do you come? They said, We are from Charan."
Genesis,29,5,"He said to them, Do you know Lavan, the son of Nachor? They said, We know him."
Genesis,29,6,"He said to them, Is he doing well? They said, He is doing well. Behold Rochel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."
Genesis,29,7,"He said to them, The day is yet long, it is not yet time for the sheep to be gathered, water the sheep and go pasture them."
Genesis,29,8,"They said, We cannot [do so] until all the flocks have gathered and [the shepherds] roll the stone from the mouth of the well. Then we can water the sheep."
Genesis,29,9,"While he was still speaking with them, Rochel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
Genesis,29,10,"When Yaakov saw Rochel, the daughter of Lavan, his mother’s brother, with the sheep of Lavan, his mother’s brother, he stepped near and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well. He then watered the sheep of Lavan, his mother’s brother."
Genesis,29,11,Yaakov kissed Rochel and cried in a loud voice.
Genesis,29,12,"Yaakov told Rochel that he was a relative of her father [<b>the son of her father’s sister</b>], that he was the son of Rivkah. She ran and told her father."
Genesis,29,13,"When Lavan heard the news of Yaakov, his sister’s son, he ran to greet him. He embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. [Yaakov] told Lavan all that had happened."
Genesis,29,14,"Lavan said to him, Nevertheless, you are my bone [<b>relative</b>] and flesh. [Yaakov] lived with him for a month."
Genesis,29,15,"Lavan said to Yaakov, Just because you are my relative, must you work for me without pay? Tell me, [what should] your wages [be]?"
Genesis,29,16,"Lavan had two daughters. The name of the older one was Leah, and the name of the younger one was Rochel."
Genesis,29,17,The eyes of Leah were tender [<b>beautiful</b>]. Rochel was of beautiful form and of beautiful appearance.
Genesis,29,18,"Yaakov loved Rochel. and he said, I will work for you seven years for Rochel, your younger daughter."
Genesis,29,19,"Lavan said, Better that I give her to you than I should give her to another man. [Remain] living with me."
Genesis,29,20,"Yaakov worked seven years for Rochel, but they seemed to him like a few days, so much did he love her."
Genesis,29,21,"Yaakov said to Lavan, Give me my wife, for my term [<b>of labor</b>] is completed; and thus I will consummate the marriage with her."
Genesis,29,22,Lavan gathered all the local people and he made a [wedding] feast.
Genesis,29,23,"When it was evening, he took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to him [Yaakov]. He consummated the marriage with her."
Genesis,29,24,"Lavan gave Zilpah, his servant to her, to Leah, his daughter as a handmaid."
Genesis,29,25,"When it was morning, behold it was Leah! He [Yaakov] said to Lavan, What have you done to me? Did I not work with you for Rochel? Why did you deceive me?"
Genesis,29,26,"Lavan said, It is not done so in our place, to give the younger [daughter in marriage] before the firstborn."
Genesis,29,27,Complete the [marriage] week for this one. We will then give you the other also—in return for the work that you will do with me for another seven years.
Genesis,29,28,"Yaakov did so, and he completed the [marriage] week for this one [Leah]. He [Lavan] then gave Rochel, his daughter to him as a wife."
Genesis,29,29,"To his daughter, Rochel, Lavan gave his servant Bilhah, to be her handmaid."
Genesis,29,30,"He [Yaakov] also consummated his marriage with Rochel. He loved Rochel more than Leah, and he worked with [Lavan] additionally, another seven years."
Genesis,29,31,"Adonoy saw that Leah was the hated one, and He opened her womb [<b>allowed her to conceive</b>]. Rochel remained barren."
Genesis,29,32,"Leah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuvein, as she said, Adonoy has seen my affliction [<b>was revealed before Adonoy</b>]; for now my husband will love me."
Genesis,29,33,"She conceived again and gave birth to a son. She said, Since Adonoy [<b>it was</b>] heard [<b>before Adonoy</b>] that I am the hated one, He also gave me this one, and she named him Shimon."
Genesis,29,34,"She conceived again and gave birth to a son. She said, This time my husband will become attached to me, for I have born him three sons. He therefore named him Leivi."
Genesis,29,35,"She conceived again and gave birth to a son. She said, This time I will [<b>give</b>] praise [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. She therefore named him Yehudah. She then stopped giving birth."
Genesis,30,1,"Rochel saw that she was not bearing children to Yaakov. Rochel became jealous of her sister, and she said to Yaakov, Give me children; if not I am [considered] dead."
Genesis,30,2,"Yaakov became very angry with Rochel, and he said, Am I in God’s place? [<b>Are you asking me? Is it not from before God that you should ask?</b>] [It is He] who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb."
Genesis,30,3,"She said, Here is my handmaid, Bilhah, consummate a marriage with her. Let her give birth upon my knees [<b>and I will rear them</b>], and I too will have a son [<b>be built up</b>] through her."
Genesis,30,4,"She gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, as a wife and Yaakov consummated the marriage with her."
Genesis,30,5,Bilhah conceived and bore Yaakov a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Rochel said, Elohim has judged me. He has also heard my voice [<b>accepted my prayer</b>], and has given me a son. She therefore named him Don."
Genesis,30,7,"She conceived again, and Bilhah, Rochel’s handmaid, bore a second son to Yaakov."
Genesis,30,8,"Rochel said, With Elohim’s bonds, I have been joined to my sister, and I have also prevailed [<b>Elohim accepted my request, when I pleaded in my prayer, I desired that I would have offspring like my sister, it was also given to me</b>]. She [therefore] called him Naftali."
Genesis,30,9,"Leah realized that she was no longer bearing children. She [therefore] took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Yaakov as a wife."
Genesis,30,10,"Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, bore Yaakov a son."
Genesis,30,11,"Leah said, Unexpected success has come, and she named him Gad."
Genesis,30,12,"Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid bore a second son to Yaakov."
Genesis,30,13,"Leah said, It is in my good fortune that daughters [women] will consider me fortunate. [<b>Praise is mine, because women will praise me from now.</b>] She named him Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"Reuvein went in the days of the wheat harvest, and found jasmine flowers in the field. He brought them to Leah, his mother. Rochel said to Leah, Please [<b>Now</b>] give me some of your son’s jasmine flowers."
Genesis,30,15,"She [Leah] said to her, Isn’t it enough that you took my husband? Would you also take my son’s jasmine flowers? Rochel said, Therefore, he shall be with you tonight in exchange for your son’s jasmine flowers."
Genesis,30,16,"Yaakov came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him. She said, You will come to me, for I have hired you with my son’s jasmine flowers, and he was with her at night."
Genesis,30,17,Elohim perceived [<b>accepted</b>] Leah’s [wish] [<b>prayer</b>]. She conceived and bore [her] fifth son to Yaakov.
Genesis,30,18,"Leah said, Elohim has given me my reward because I gave my handmaid to my husband. She named him Yissachar."
Genesis,30,19,Leah conceived again and bore [her] sixth son to Yaakov.
Genesis,30,20,"Leah said, Elohim has given [<b>me</b>] a goodly portion. Now my husband will make his [main] home with me, for I have borne him six sons. She named him Zevulun."
Genesis,30,21,"Afterwards she gave birth to a daughter, and named her Deenah."
Genesis,30,22,"Elohim remembered Rochel [<b>The remembrance of Rochel came before Elohim, and Elohim perceived her plight</b>] [<b>accepted her prayer</b>] and opened her womb [<b>allowed her to conceive</b>]."
Genesis,30,23,"She conceived and gave birth to a son. She said, Elohim has removed my shame."
Genesis,30,24,"She named him Yoseif, saying, May Adonoy add to me another son."
Genesis,30,25,"When Rochel had given birth to Yoseif, Yaakov said to Lavan, Send me on my way, and I will go to my own place and to my homeland."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me [permission to take] my wives and my children, for whom I worked for you, and I will go; for you know my work that I did for you."
Genesis,30,27,"Lavan said to him, If [<b>now</b>] I have found favor in your eyes, I have divined [<b>determined</b>] that Adonoy has blessed me because of you."
Genesis,30,28,"He said, Set your wage for me, and I will give it."
Genesis,30,29,"He [Yaakov] said to him, You know how I worked for you, and how your livestock were with me."
Genesis,30,30,For the little you had before I came here has increased and has become a multitude. Adonoy has blessed you with my coming [<b>for my sake</b>]. Now when will I also do something for my own house?
Genesis,30,31,"He [Lavan] said, What shall I give you? Yaakov said, Do not give me anything—if you do this thing for me. I will continue to tend your flock and guard it."
Genesis,30,32,"I will go through all your flocks this day. I will remove from them every lamb that is speckled, or spotted, and every dark one among the sheep, and every goat that is spotted and speckled. That [kind] will be my wage."
Genesis,30,33,"My righteousness shall testify for me in the future when it comes before you regarding my wage. Any goat which is not speckled or spotted, and any sheep that is [not] dark, is stolen [if it is] in my possession."
Genesis,30,34,"Lavan said, Agreed, may it be as you say."
Genesis,30,35,"That day he [Lavan] removed the he-goats that were ringed and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, everyone that had white in it, and all the dark ones among the sheep; and he gave them to his sons."
Genesis,30,36,He placed a three days journey between himself and Yaakov. Yaakov tended Lavan’s remaining flocks.
Genesis,30,37,"Yaakov took rods of poplar that were fresh, hazel and chestnut [trees], and peeled white stripes in them by uncovering the white which is in the rods."
Genesis,30,38,"He stuck [<b>inserted</b>] the rods that he had peeled into the ducts of the [<b>place of the</b>] watering troughs [<b>the place</b>] where the flock [ewes] came to drink, facing the flock [rams]; that they should become heated when they came to drink."
Genesis,30,39,"The flock [<b>sheep</b>] became heated [and mated] before the rods, and the flock [<b>sheep</b>] gave birth to ringed, speckled and spotted [offspring]."
Genesis,30,40,"Yaakov separated the lambs. He set the faces [<b>at the head</b>] of the flock [<b>sheep</b>] toward [<b>all</b>] the ringed ones and all the dark ones; [he did so] with Lavan’s flocks. He formed separate flocks of his own, and did not set [<b>mix</b>] them with Lavan’s flocks."
Genesis,30,41,"When the early-bearing flock [<b>sheep</b>] were heated [to mate], Yaakov placed the rods before the flock’s [<b>sheep’s</b>] eyes at the ducts, so they would be in heat among the rods."
Genesis,30,42,"But when the flock [<b>sheep</b>] were late-bearing, he did not place [the rods before them]. Thus the late-bearing ones were Lavan’s, and the early-bearing ones became the possession of Yaakov."
Genesis,30,43,"The man became tremendously prosperous. He had multipying flocks, female slaves and male slaves, camels and donkeys."
Genesis,31,1,"He [Yaakov] heard the words of Lavan’s sons [who were] saying, Yaakov has taken all that belonged to our father. From that which was our father’s, he made [<b>acquired</b>] all this wealth [<b>these possessions</b>]."
Genesis,31,2,Yaakov saw [<b>the expression of</b>] Lavan’s face [demeanor] and it was not toward him as it was before.
Genesis,31,3,"Adonoy said to Yaakov, Return to the land of your fathers and to your birthplace, and I will be with you [<b>My Word will be your support</b>]."
Genesis,31,4,"Yaakov sent and called Rochel and Leah to [come to] the field, to his flock."
Genesis,31,5,"He said to them, I saw [<b>the expression of</b>] your father’s face; it is not toward me as it was before, but the God of my father was with me [<b>my support</b>]."
Genesis,31,6,You know that I served your father with all my strength.
Genesis,31,7,Your father cheated me and changed my wage ten countings; but Elohim did not let him harm me.
Genesis,31,8,"If he would say, The speckled will be your wage, then all the flock [<b>sheep</b>] gave birth to speckled ones. If he would say, Ringed ones will be your wage, all the flock [<b>sheep</b>] gave birth to ringed ones."
Genesis,31,9,"Thus God delivered [<b>separated</b>] your father’s livestock, and gave it to me."
Genesis,31,10,"At the time the flock [<b>sheep</b>] were in heat [to mate], I lifted my eyes, and in a dream I saw that the males [<b>rams</b>] going upon the flock [<b>sheep</b>] were ringed, speckled and striped."
Genesis,31,11,"An angel of Elohim said to me in a dream, Yaakov, and I said, Here I am."
Genesis,31,12,"He said, Lift up your eyes [<b>now</b>] and see, all the males [<b>rams</b>] going up on the flock [<b>sheep</b>] are ringed, speckled, and striped; for I have seen all that Lavan is doing to you [<b>is revealed before Me</b>]."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the Almighty of Elohim who appeared to you in Beis Eil, where you anointed a monument, where you made a vow to [<b>before</b>] Me. Now arise and leave this land, and return to the land of your birthplace."
Genesis,31,14,"Rochel and Leah replied and said to him, Do we still have a portion and an inheritance in our father’s house?"
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not considered by him as strangers? For he has sold us, and has completely consumed our money."
Genesis,31,16,"All the wealth that Elohim rescued [<b>separated</b>] from our father belongs to us and our children. Now, whatever God has said to you, do it."
Genesis,31,17,Yaakov rose and lifted his sons and his wives upon the camels.
Genesis,31,18,"He led away all his livestock, and all his possessions that he had acquired, which he had purchased with his own livestock that he had acquired in Padan Aram, [in order] to come to Yitzchok, his father, to the land of Canaan."
Genesis,31,19,"Lavan [meanwhile] had gone to shear his flock [<b>sheep</b>], and Rochel stole [<b>hid</b>] the idols that belonged to her father."
Genesis,31,20,"Yaakov fooled [<b>concealed his intentions from the heart of</b>] Lavan, the Aramean, by not telling him that he had fled [<b>gone</b>]."
Genesis,31,21,"He fled [<b>went</b>] with all that he possessed. He set out and crossed the river [<b>P’ras</b>], setting out in the direction of Mount Gilod."
Genesis,31,22,Lavan was told on the third day that Yaakov had fled [<b>gone</b>].
Genesis,31,23,"He took his brothers [kinsmen] with him, and pursued him a distance of seven days. He overtook him in Mount Gilod."
Genesis,31,24,"Elohim appeared [<b>The Word came from before Elohim</b>] to Lavan the Aramean, in a dream that night, and said to him, Guard yourself, that you do not speak to Yaakov either good or evil."
Genesis,31,25,"Lavan overtook Yaakov. Yaakov had set up [<b>spread</b>] his tents on the mountain, and Lavan and his brothers had set up [<b>encamped</b>] on Mount Gilod."
Genesis,31,26,"Lavan said to Yaakov, What have you done? You fooled [<b>hid from</b>] me, and led my daughters away like prisoners of war."
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you flee [<b>go</b>] so stealthily? You robbed [<b>hid from</b>] me and did not tell me. I would have sent you away, with joy and with song, with drum[<b>s</b>] and harp[<b>s</b>]."
Genesis,31,28,You did not let me kiss my [grand]sons and daughters. Now see how foolishly you acted.
Genesis,31,29,"It is within the power of my hand to harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, Guard yourself not to speak to Yaakov either good or evil."
Genesis,31,30,"Now you have gone for you yearned for your father’s house, but why did you steal [<b>take</b>] my gods?"
Genesis,31,31,"Yaakov replied and said to Lavan, Because I was afraid, for I said you might forcibly take your daughters from me."
Genesis,31,32,"With whomsoever you find your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our brethren, identify anything belonging to you that is here with me and take it back with you. Yaakov did not know that Rochel had stolen [<b>taken</b>] them."
Genesis,31,33,"Lavan came into Yaakov’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tents of the two handmaids [<b>concubines</b>], but he found nothing. He left Leah’s tent and came into Rochel’s tent."
Genesis,31,34,"Rochel had taken the idols, and placed them in the camel’s saddle-pillow, and sat upon them. Lavan searched the whole tent and found nothing."
Genesis,31,35,"She said to her father, Let there not be anger in the eyes of my master that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me. He searched but did not find the idols."
Genesis,31,36,"Yaakov was angry and he argued with Lavan. Yaakov replied and said to Lavan, What is my crime? What sin did I commit that you were in such hot pursuit of me?"
Genesis,31,37,"When you searched all my goods, what did you find of all your household goods? Place it here in the presence of my brethren and your brethren, and let them decide between the two of us."
Genesis,31,38,"These twenty years that I was with you, your ewes and she-goats never miscarried, and I did not eat any rams of your flocks."
Genesis,31,39,I never brought you a mutilated animal. I will take the blame for it. You demanded compensation from my hand whether [an animal] was stolen from me by day or whether it was stolen from me by night. [<b>You demanded compensation from me for that which was missing from the total. I guarded by day and I guarded by night.</b>]
Genesis,31,40,I was consumed by the burning heat by day and ice [<b>frost came down upon me</b>] at night. My sleep was taken from my eyes.
Genesis,31,41,"These twenty years that I have been in your house, I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your sheep, but you changed my wages ten times."
Genesis,31,42,"Had not the God of my father, the God of Avraham and the Fear of Yitzchok been with me [<b>my support</b>], you would have sent me away empty-handed. My misery [<b>toil</b>] and the labor [<b>weariness</b>] of my hands was seen by [<b>revealed before</b>] Elohim, and He reprimanded you last night."
Genesis,31,43,"Lavan replied and said to Yaakov, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the[se] flocks are my flocks. All that you see is mine. What can I do unto these, my daughters, today, or to their children that they have born."
Genesis,31,44,"Now come [therefore] let us make a pact, I and you. Let Him be witness between me and you."
Genesis,31,45,Yaakov took a boulder and raised it as a monument.
Genesis,31,46,"Yaakov said to his brethren, Gather stones. They took stones and made a mound, and they ate on the mound."
Genesis,31,47,"Lavan called it Yegar Sohadusa, but Yaakov called it Galeid."
Genesis,31,48,"Lavan said, This mound is witness between me and you this day. He therefore called its name Galeid."

Genesis,31,51,"Lavan said to Yaakov, Here is this mound, and here is this monument that I have cast [<b>established</b>] between me and you."
Genesis,31,52,"This mound is witness, and the monument is witness, that I will not cross over to you beyond this mound; and you are not to cross over to me beyond this mound and this monument for harmful purposes."
Genesis,31,53,"The God of Avraham and the god of Nachor, the god of their fathers will judge between us. Yaakov swore by the Fear of his father, Yitzchok [<b>He who Yitchok his father feared</b>]."

Genesis,32,3,"When Yaakov saw them, he said, This is Elohim’s camp. [<b>This is a camp from before Elohim.</b>] He named the place Machanayim."
Genesis,32,4,"Yaakov sent messengers before him to Eisov, his brother, to the Land of Seir, to the field of Edom."

Genesis,32,10,"Yaakov said, God of my father Avraham, and God of my father Yitzchok, Adonoy Who said to me, Return to your land, to your birthplace, and I will do good with you."
Genesis,32,11,"I am unworthy [<b>My merits are few</b>] because of all the kindness and of all the faithfulness [<b>goodness</b>] that you have done with Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan [only] with my staff [<b>alone</b>], and now I have become two camps."
Genesis,32,12,"Rescue me, I pray [<b>now</b>], from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eisov, for I fear him, that he will come and attack me—mother and children alike."

Genesis,32,17,"He placed them in the hand of his servants, each herd by itself. He said to his servants, Pass on ahead of me, and keep a space between each herd."
Genesis,32,18,"He commanded the first one, saying, When my brother, Eisov meets you and asks you saying, To whom do you belong, and where are you going; and who is the owner of this that is before you?"
Genesis,32,19,"You should [then] say, [They belong] to your servant, Yaakov. It is a present sent to my master, Eisov, and see, he is also [<b>coming</b>] behind us."
Genesis,32,20,"He also commanded the second and also the third, and to all who followed after the herds, saying, In like manner must you speak to Eisov when you find [meet] him."
Genesis,32,21,"You should also say, See, your servant Yaakov is [<b>coming</b>] behind us. For he said, I will appease him [<b>quieten his anger</b>] with the present that goes before me, and afterwards I will see his face, perhaps he will forgive me."
Genesis,32,22,"The present passed on ahead of him, but he spent the night in the camp."
Genesis,32,23,"He got up that night and took his two wives, his two handmaids [<b>concubines</b>], and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of the Yabbok [River]."

Genesis,32,25,"Yaakov remained alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak."

Genesis,32,28,"He [the man] said to him, What is your name? And he replied, Yaakov."
Genesis,32,29,"He [the man] said, No longer will your name be spoken of as Yaakov, but as Yisrael, for you have contended with God[ly beings] [<b>are great before God</b>] and with men, and you have won."

Genesis,32,33,"Therefore, the children of Israel must not eat the displaced tendon [nerve] which is on the [<b>girth of the</b>] hip joint to this very day; because he struck [<b>the girth of</b>] Yaakov’s hip joint on the displaced tendon."
Genesis,33,1,"Yaakov raised his eyes and saw that Eisov was coming, and with him there were four hundred men. He then divided the children among Leah, Rochel and the two handmaids [<b>concubines</b>]."
Genesis,33,2,"He placed the handmaids [<b>concubines</b>] and their children foremost, Leah and her sons behind them, and Rochel and Yoseif in the rear."
Genesis,33,3,"He went ahead of them, and he prostrated himself to the earth seven times, until he approached his brother."
Genesis,33,4,Eisov ran to meet him. He hugged him and fell on his neck and kissed him. They [both] wept.
Genesis,33,5,"[Eisov] raised his eyes and saw the women and children. He said, Who are these to you? He [Yaakov] said, These are the children whom God has graciously [<b>compassionately</b>] granted your servant."
Genesis,33,6,"The handmaids [<b>concubines</b>] [then] approached, they, and their children, and prostrated themselves."
Genesis,33,7,"Leah and her children also approached and prostrated themselves, and finally Yoseif and Rochel approached and prostrated themselves."
Genesis,33,8,"He [Eisov] said, What do you have to do with that whole camp that approached me? He [Yaakov] said, It was to find favor in the eyes of my master."
Genesis,33,9,"Eisov said, I have plenty. My brother, let what you have remain yours [<b>be successful</b>]."
Genesis,33,10,"Yaakov said, Please, no. If I have found favor in your eyes [<b>now</b>], take [<b>accept</b>] my present from my hand, because I have seen your face [and it was] like seeing the face of a God[ly being] [<b>great ones</b>]; and you have received me favorably."
Genesis,33,11,"Please [<b>Now</b>] accept my blessing [<b>present</b>] as it was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me, for I have everything. He thus urged him and he took [<b>accepted</b>] it."
Genesis,33,12,"He [Eisov] said, Go and we will move on, and I will move on with you."
Genesis,33,13,"He [Yaakov] said to him, My master knows that the children are delicate, and that the sheep and cattle with me are nursing. If they are driven hard for [even] one day, all the sheep will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Please [<b>Now</b>] my master, go on ahead of your servant. I will lead on gently, in my slow pace, according to the pace of the work that is before me, and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my master in Seir."
Genesis,33,15,"Eisov said, Let me leave [<b>now</b>] with you some of the people that are with me. He [Yaakov] said, What for? Let me find favor in the eyes of my master."

Genesis,33,17,"Yaakov traveled to Sukkos and built himself a house, and for his livestock he made shelters. He therefore named the place Sukkos."
Genesis,33,18,"Yaakov arrived safely at the city of Shechem, which is in the Land of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram. He encamped before the city."
Genesis,33,19,"He bought the part [<b>possession</b>] of the field where he had spread his tent, from the sons of Chamor, father of Shechem, for one hundred kesitahs [<b>sheep</b>]."
Genesis,33,20,He erected an altar there and called it [<b>worshiped upon it before</b>] the Almighty is [<b>the</b>] God of Yisrael.

Genesis,34,6,"Chamor, father of Shechem, went out to Yaakov to speak with him."
Genesis,34,7,"The sons of Yaakov returned from the field when they heard [what had happened]. The men grieved and were very angry, for he [Shechem] had committed an outrage against Yisrael to lie with a daughter of Yaakov. Such a thing should not be done [<b>It is not fitting for such a think to have been done</b>]."
Genesis,34,8,"Chamor spoke with them saying, My son, Shechem, desires your daughter. Please [<b>Now</b>] grant her to him for a wife."
Genesis,34,9,"Intermarry with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves."

Genesis,34,13,"The sons of Yaakov answered Shechem, and his father Chamor, with guile [<b>cleverness</b>], when they spoke; because he had defiled their sister, Deenah."
Genesis,34,14,"They said to them, We cannot do such a thing—to give our sister [in marriage] to an uncircumcised man, for that is a disgrace to us."
Genesis,34,15,"This is the only way we will consent to you: if you will be like us, circumcising all your males."
Genesis,34,16,"[Then] we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves. We will live together with you, and we will become one people."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you do not listen to [<b>obey</b>] us to be circumcised, we will take our daughter and go."

Genesis,34,21,"These men are completely at peace with us. Let them live in the land and [<b>do</b>] trade in [<b>with</b>] it. The land has ample room to be open to them. We will take their daughters for wives, and we will give them our daughters."
Genesis,34,22,"But only on these terms will the men consent to live with us, to become one people: every male among us must be circumcised, just as they are circumcised."
Genesis,34,23,"Their livestock, their possessions and all their cattle, will it not be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us."

Genesis,34,26,They killed Chamor and his son Shechem at the point of the sword. They took Deenah from the house of Shechem and they left.
Genesis,34,27,"The sons of Yaakov came upon the corpses [<b>to strip the corpses</b>], and they plundered the city that had defiled their sister."

Genesis,37,23,"When Yoseif came to his brothers, they stripped him of his coat, the long, colorful coat that he had on."
Genesis,37,24,They took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis,37,25,"They sat down [<b>reclined</b>] to eat bread. They raised their eyes and saw—behold a Yishmaelite [<b>Arabian</b>] caravan was coming from Gilod. Their camels were carrying spices, balsam and lotus, bringing them down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"Yehudah said to his brothers, What [<b>monetary benefit</b>] will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come let us sell him to the Yishmaelites [<b>Arabs</b>], and let our hands not be upon him; for he is our brother, our own flesh. His brothers listened [to him.] [<b>obeyed him</b>]."
Genesis,37,28,Midianite merchants passed by. They [the brothers] pulled Yoseif up from the pit and sold Yoseif to the Yishmaelites [<b>Arabs</b>] for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Yoseif to Egypt.
Genesis,37,29,"Reuvein returned to the pit, but behold, Yoseif was not in the pit. He [then] tore his clothes [in grief.]"
Genesis,37,30,"He returned to his brothers and said, The boy is not there; and I—where can I go."
Genesis,37,31,"They took Yoseif’s coat, slaughtered a [<b>male</b>] goat, and dipped the coat in the blood."
Genesis,37,32,"They sent the long, colorful coat and brought it to their father, and said, We found this. Please [<b>Now</b>] identify it. Is it your son’s coat or not?"
Genesis,37,33,"He recognized it and said, It is my son’s coat. An evil beast has devoured him. Yoseif has been torn to pieces [<b>surely killed</b>]."
Genesis,37,34,"Yaakov tore his robes, and placed sackcloth on his loins. He mourned for his son for many days."
Genesis,37,35,"All his sons and all his daughters rose to console him, but he refused to be consoled [<b>accept consolation</b>]. He said, I will go down to the grave [<b>while I am still</b>] mourning for my son. His father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"The Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the chief of the slaughterers."
Genesis,38,1,"And it was at that time, that Yehudah descended from his brothers. He turned away [from them], until [he came to] a man, an Adullamite, whose name was Chirah."
Genesis,38,2,There Yehudah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man [<b>merchant</b>] whose name was Shu’a. He took her and consummated a marriage with her.
Genesis,38,3,She conceived and gave birth to a son. He named him Er.
Genesis,38,4,She conceived again and gave birth to a son. She named him Onan.
Genesis,38,5,She conceived once again and gave birth to a son. She named him Sheilah. He [Yehudah] was in Keziv when she gave birth to him.
Genesis,38,6,"Yehudah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"Er, Yehudah’s firstborn was wicked in the eyes of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, and Adonoy put him to death."
Genesis,38,8,"Yehudah said to Onan, Consummate marriage with your brother’s wife, and fulfill the yibum rite with her, and establish seed for your brother."
Genesis,38,9,"Onan knew that the descendants would not be his [<b>called by his name</b>]. Whenever he cohabited with his brother’s wife, he let it go to waste [<b>destroyed his way</b>] on the ground, in order not to give [<b>establish</b>] progeny to his brother."
Genesis,38,10,"What he did was evil in the eyes of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, and He also put him to death."
Genesis,38,11,"Yehudah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Live as a widow in your father’s house until my son Sheilah is of age. He said, Lest he also die like his brothers. Tamar went and lived in her father’s house."
Genesis,38,12,"Many days passed, and Shu’a’s daughter, the wife of Yehudah died. Yehudah sought consolation, and went up to his sheep-shearers—he and his friend, Chirah the Adullamite—to Timnah."
Genesis,38,13,"Tamar was told, Behold your father-in-law has come to Timnah, to shear his sheep."
Genesis,38,14,"She took off her widow’s garb, covered herself with a veil, and disguised [<b>adorned</b>] herself. She sat at the crossroads which is on the road to Timnah, for she saw that Sheilah had come of age and she had not been given to him for a wife."
Genesis,38,15,"Yehudah saw her and thought she was a harlot [<b>like one who goes outside</b>], because she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"He turned aside to her on the road, and said, Please [<b>Now</b>], let me be with you, for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, What will you give me for the privilege of being with me?"
Genesis,38,17,"He said, I will send you a kid from the flock. She said, [Only] if you give me some security until you send it."
Genesis,38,18,"He said, What security shall I give you? She said, Your signet ring, your wrap, and your staff that is in your hand. He gave them to her and was with her, and she became pregnant by him."
Genesis,38,19,"She got up and went away. She took off her veil, and put on her widow’s garb."
Genesis,38,20,"Yehudah sent the goat-kid with his friend the Adullamite, to retrieve the security from the woman, but he could not find her."
Genesis,38,21,"He asked the men of her place, Where is the harlot that was at the junction, on the road? They said, There was [<b>is</b>] no harlot here."
Genesis,38,22,"He returned to Yehudah and said, I did not find her, and the men of her place also said that there was [<b>is</b>] no harlot there [<b>here</b>]."
Genesis,38,23,"Yehudah said, Let her take it, lest we are humiliated [<b>become a laughingstock</b>]. Behold I sent her this kid, and you could not find her."
Genesis,38,24,"About three months later, Yehudah was told, Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has been promiscuous, moreover, her promiscuity has resulted in pregnancy. Yehudah said, Take her out and let her be burned."
Genesis,38,25,"She was being taken out, and she sent [word] to her father-in-law saying, By the man to whom these belong [<b>from him</b>] am I pregnant. She said, Please [<b>Now</b>] recognize to whom this signet, wrap and staff belong."
Genesis,38,26,"Yehudah recognized them and said, She is righteous, [it is] from me [<b>that she conceived</b>], inasmuch that I did not give her to my son Sheilah. He was not intimate with her any more."
Genesis,38,27,"When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand. The midwife took it and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, This one emerged first."
Genesis,38,29,"When he put back his hand, behold his brother emerged, and she said, With what [<b>great</b>] strength you have pushed yourself. He named him Peretz."
Genesis,38,30,Then his brother emerged—the one upon whose hand was the scarlet thread. He named him Zorach.
Genesis,39,1,"Yoseif was brought down to Egypt. He was purchased by Potiphar—an officer of Pharaoh, the chief of the slaughterers, an Egyptian—from the Yishmaelites [<b>Arabs</b>] who had brought him down there."
Genesis,39,2,"[<b>The Word of</b>] Adonoy was with Yoseif[<b>’s support</b>], and he was successful. He was [a servant] in the house of his master, the Egyptian."
Genesis,39,3,"His master saw that [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy was with him [<b>supported him</b>], and that whatever he did, Adonoy made it succeed through his hand."
Genesis,39,4,"Yoseif found favor in his eyes, and he served him personally. He appointed him supervisor over his household, and all that he possessed he placed in his hand."
Genesis,39,5,"From the time he appointed him supervisor over his household and over all that he possessed, Adonoy blessed the house of the Egyptian for Yoseif’s sake. The blessing of Adonoy was in all that he possessed, in the house and in the field."
Genesis,39,6,"He left everything he possessed in the hand of Yoseif. He did not concern himself with anything about him, except for the bread he ate. Yoseif was well-built and good looking."
Genesis,39,7,"After these events, his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Yoseif, and she said, Be with me."
Genesis,39,8,"He refused and said to his master’s wife, Behold, my master knows nothing about what I am doing in the house, and all that he possess, he has placed in my hands."
Genesis,39,9,"No one in this house is greater than me. He has not withheld anything from me other than you, for you are his wife. How can I do such a great evil, and sin against [<b>before</b>] God."
Genesis,39,10,"Even though she spoke to Yoseif every day, he would not listen to [<b>obey</b>] her, to lie next to her, [nor] to be with her."
Genesis,39,11,"It was on such a day, that he came to the house to do his work [<b>examine the recordings of his accounts</b>]. No man of the household was there in the house."
Genesis,39,12,"She grabbed him by his garment, saying, Be with me. He left his garment in her hand, and fled, and he went outside [<b>to the marketplace</b>]."
Genesis,39,13,"It was when she saw that he left his garment in her hand and had fled outside [<b>to the marketplace</b>],"
Genesis,39,14,"that she called to the men of the household and said to them, See, he brought us a Hebrew man to mock us. He came to be with me, and I called out in a loud voice."
Genesis,39,15,"When he heard that I raised my voice and cried out, he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside [<b>to the marketplace</b>]."
Genesis,39,16,She laid his garment near her until his master came home.
Genesis,39,17,"She spoke to him [her husband] according to these words, saying, The Hebrew slave came to me—the same one you brought into us—[he came to] mock me."
Genesis,39,18,"When I raised my voice and cried out, he left his garment with me and fled outside [<b>to the marketplace</b>]."
Genesis,39,19,"When his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, Your slave did such things to me, he became furious."
Genesis,39,20,"Yoseif’s master took him and placed him in [<b>appointed him over</b>] the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were jailed. He remained there in the prison."
Genesis,39,21,"[<b>The Word of</b>] Adonoy was with Yoseif[<b>’s support</b>], and extended kindness to him, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison chief."
Genesis,39,22,"The prison chief gave [<b>appointed</b>] Yoseif [<b>to be in</b>] control over all the prisoners in the prison, and everything that had to be done there, he was the one who did it [<b>it was done by his word</b>]."
Genesis,39,23,"The prison chief did not have to look after anything that was under [<b>see any offense committed by</b>] his hand, because [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy was with him [<b>his support</b>] and whatever he did, Adonoy made him succeed."
Genesis,40,1,"After these events, an offense was committed by the Egyptian king’s butler and baker against their master, the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"Pharaoh was enraged at his two officials, the chief butler and the chief baker."
Genesis,40,3,"He placed them under guard in the house of the chief executioner, in the prison, where Yoseif was imprisoned."
Genesis,40,4,The chief of the slaughterers appointed Yoseif to be with them and he served them. They were under guard for a period of time.
Genesis,40,5,"The two of them had a dream. Each of them had his dream on the same night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the prison."
Genesis,40,6,"Yoseif came to them in the morning, and he saw them, and behold they were troubled."
Genesis,40,7,"He asked Pharaoh’s officials, who were with him, under guard in his master’s house, saying, Why do you look so bad today?"
Genesis,40,8,"They said to him, We had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. Yoseif said to them, Do not [<b>Are</b>] interpretations [<b>of dreams</b>] belong to [<b>not from</b>] God. Tell them to me, please [<b>now</b>]."
Genesis,40,9,"The butler told his dream to Yoseif. He said to him, In my dream, behold a grape vine was before me."
Genesis,40,10,"On the vine there were three branches, as [<b>when</b>] if budding, [<b>it brought out blossoms and</b>] its [<b>the</b>] blossoms blooming, and its clusters ripening into grapes."
Genesis,40,11,Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup. I then placed the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
Genesis,40,12,"Yoseif said to him, This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days."
Genesis,40,13,"In another [<b>At the end of</b>] three days, Pharaoh will lift [<b>take</b>] your head, and restore you to your position. You will place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, as was your previous practice when you were his butler."
Genesis,40,14,"But remember me when things go well with you. Please [<b>Now</b>] deal kindly with me [<b>with goodness</b>], and mention me to [<b>before</b>] Pharaoh, and take me out of this house [<b>prison</b>]."
Genesis,40,15,"I was kidnaped from the land of the Hebrews, and here I have also done nothing that they should have put me in this dungeon [<b>prison</b>]."
Genesis,40,16,"The chief baker saw that he interpreted well. He said to Yoseif, I, too, dreamed. Behold there were three fancy baskets on my head."
Genesis,40,17,"In the top basket there were various kinds of food for Pharaoh, consisting of baked goods, and the bird was eating them from the basket that was on my head."
Genesis,40,18,"Yoseif replied and said, This is its interpretation: The three baskets represent three days."
Genesis,40,19,"In another [<b>At the end of</b>] three days, Pharaoh will lift [<b>remove</b>] your head from off you. He will hang you on a tree, and the bird will eat your flesh from off you."
Genesis,40,20,"It was on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he [Pharaoh] made a feast for all his servants. He lifted [<b>remembered</b>] the head of the chief butler, and the head of the chief baker among his servants."
Genesis,40,21,"He restored the chief butler to his position, and he presented the cup into Pharaoh’s hand."
Genesis,40,22,"The chief baker, he hung, just as Yoseif had interpreted to them."
Genesis,40,23,"[However] the chief butler did not remember Yoseif, but forgot him."
Genesis,41,1,"It was at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing on the bank of the river."
Genesis,41,2,"Behold, from the river emerged seven cows, fine-looking and well-fleshed, and they were grazing in the reed grass."
Genesis,41,3,"And behold, seven other cows emerged after them, from the river, bad-looking and thin-fleshed, and they stood next to [<b>opposite</b>] the cows that were [already] on the bank of the river."
Genesis,41,4,"They ate—the bad looking, thin-fleshed cows [then ate] the seven fine looking, healthy cows, and Pharaoh woke up."
Genesis,41,5,"He fell asleep and had a second dream. Behold, seven ears of grain [corn] came up on a single stalk, wholesome and good."
Genesis,41,6,"And behold, seven ears, thin [<b>smitten</b>] and scorched [<b>beaten</b>] by the east wind, grew up after them."
Genesis,41,7,"The seven thin [<b>smitten</b>] ears swallowed the seven wholesome, full ears. Pharaoh woke up, and behold it was a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"In the morning, he was agitated [<b>his spirit was beaten</b>]. He sent and summoned all the wizards of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh related his dream to them, but none could interpret them for Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"The chief butler spoke to Pharaoh saying, I recall my sins today:"
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was enraged at his servants, and he placed me under guard in the house of the chief executioner; me and the chief baker."
Genesis,41,11,"We had a dream on the same night, I and he, each according to the interpretation of his dream, did we dream."
Genesis,41,12,"With us there was a lad, a Hebrew, a slave of the chief of the slaughterers. We told him [about our dreams], and he interpreted our dreams, he interpreted each man’s dream accordingly."
Genesis,41,13,"It came to pass, that as he interpreted for us, so did it occur; he restored me to my position, and him he hanged."
Genesis,41,14,"Pharaoh sent and summoned Yoseif. They hurried him out of the dungeon [<b>prison</b>], but [Yoseif first] shaved [<b>trimmed his hair</b>] and changed his clothes. And then came to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"Pharaoh said to Yoseif, I had a dream and there is no one to interpret it. I have heard it said about you that you hear a dream so as to interpret it."
Genesis,41,16,"Yoseif answered Pharaoh, saying, Not I. [<b>from my wisdom but from before</b>] God will respond [<b>there be a response</b>] to the peace of Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,17,"Pharaoh spoke to Yoseif, In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the river."
Genesis,41,18,"Behold from the river there emerged seven cows, well-fleshed and fine looking, and they were grazing in the reed grass."
Genesis,41,19,"And behold seven other cows emerged after them, poor, very bad-looking and thin-fleshed. I never saw in the entire land of Egypt, such bad looking [cows.]"
Genesis,41,20,"The thin, bad-looking cows, ate the first seven cows, which were the healthy ones."
Genesis,41,21,"They came inside them, but it could not be recognized that they had come inside them, [because] their appearance was as bad as it was previously. Then I woke up."
Genesis,41,22,"Then I saw in my dream that behold seven ears of grain [corn], wholesome and good, came up on one stalk."
Genesis,41,23,"And behold seven ears, shriveled, thin [<b>smitten</b>] and scorched [<b>beaten</b>] by the east wind, grew up after them."
Genesis,41,24,"The thin [<b>smitten</b>] ears swallowed the seven good ears. I said this to the wizards, but none of them could tell me [its meaning]."
Genesis,41,25,"Yoseif said to Pharaoh, Pharaoh’s dream is one. What God is about to do, He has told to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows represent seven years, and the seven good ears represent seven years; it is one dream."
Genesis,41,27,"The seven thin, bad [looking] cows who came up after them, represent seven years, and the seven empty [<b>smitten</b>], east wind—scorched [<b>beaten</b>] ears, represent the coming of seven years of famine."
Genesis,41,28,"This is the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is about to do, He has revealed to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,29,"Behold, seven years are coming during which there will be great abundance in the entire land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,30,"Seven years of famine will rise after them, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will devastate the land."
Genesis,41,31,"Nor will be known the [former] abundance of the land because of that famine that will follow, for it will be very severe."
Genesis,41,32,"As for the dream being repeated twice to Pharaoh, it is because the thing stands ready [<b>from</b>] before God, and God is hurrying to do it."
Genesis,41,33,"Now Pharaoh should seek a man of understanding and wisdom, and place him in charge of the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,"This is what Pharaoh should do: appoint officials [<b>faithful men</b>] over the land, and prepare the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance."
Genesis,41,35,"Let them gather in all the food [<b>grain</b>] during these good years that are coming, and let them store up grain under the hand [jurisdiction] of Pharaoh. Let the food [<b>grain</b>] be [kept] in the cities, and let them safeguard it."
Genesis,41,36,"The food [<b>grain</b>] will be held in safe-keeping [<b>stored away</b>] for the land, for the seven years of famine; which will be in the land of Egypt. Let the [<b>people of the</b>] land not be cut off by the famine."
Genesis,41,37,"This thing [plan] was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
Genesis,41,38,"Pharaoh said to his servants, Can [another] one like this be found, a man who has God’s spirit [<b>the spirit of prophecy from before God</b>] in him?"
Genesis,41,39,"Pharaoh said to Yoseif, After Elohim has informed you of all this, there is no one so understanding and wise as you."
Genesis,41,40,"You shall be [<b>appointed</b>] over my house, and by your word shall all my people be fed. Only by [virtue of] the throne [<b>of this kingdom</b>] will I be greater [<b>more honored</b>] than you."
Genesis,41,41,"Pharaoh said to Yoseif, Behold, I have placed you in charge of the entire land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,42,"Pharaoh then took off his ring from his hand, and he placed it on Yoseif’s hand. He dressed him in linen garments, and put a gold chain around his neck."
Genesis,41,43,"He had him [Yoseif] ride in his second-ranking carriage, and they proclaimed before him, Avreich [<b>”This is the associate of the king”</b>]. He thus placed him over the entire land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"Pharaoh [then] said to Yoseif, I am Pharaoh, but without you [<b>your permission</b>], no man will lift [<b>pick up</b>] his hand [<b>to carry a sword</b>] or his foot [<b>to ride upon a horse</b>] in the entire land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,45,"Pharaoh gave Yoseif the name Tzafnas Paneiach [<b>the man to whom hidden things are revealed</b>], and he gave him Osnas, the daughter of Poti Phera, priest [<b>chief</b>] of On as a wife. Yoseif [then] went out over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,"Yoseif was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Yoseif left Pharaoh’s presence, and traversed throughout the entire land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,47,The earth produced [<b>The inhabitants of the land stored up</b>] during the seven years of abundance by handfuls [<b>grain for store-houses</b>].
Genesis,41,48,"He gathered in all the food [<b>grain</b>] of the seven years [that was produced] in the land of Egypt, and placed the food [<b>grain</b>] in the cities. The food [<b>grain</b>] of the fields surrounding each city was placed within [the city]."
Genesis,41,49,"Yoseif piled up grain like the sand of the sea—in great abundance, until that they gave up counting it, because there were no [more] numbers."
Genesis,41,50,"Two sons were born to Yoseif before the years of famine came. They were born to him by Osnas, the daughter of Poti Phera, Priest [<b>chief</b>] of On."
Genesis,41,51,"Yoseif named the first-born, Menasheh, For God has made me forget all my trouble, and all that was in my father’s house."
Genesis,41,52,"He named the second one Ephraim, Because Elohim has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering [<b>servitude</b>]."
Genesis,41,53,"The seven years of abundance came to an end [<b>were completed</b>], [the good years] that were in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,54,"The seven years of famine started to come, just as Yoseif had said. There was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis,41,55,"When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all of Egypt [<b>the Egyptians</b>], Go to Yoseif. Whatever he says to you, do."
Genesis,41,56,"The famine spread over the entire face of the land. Yoseif opened everything that held grain, and sold [grain] to the Egyptians [<b>Egypt</b>]. The famine became severe in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"All [countries] [<b>inhabitants</b>] of the land came to Egypt to buy [grain] from Yoseif, for the famine was severe in all the land."
Genesis,42,1,"Yaakov saw that food [<b>grain</b>] was being sold in Egypt. Yaakov said to his sons, Why would you have everyone gazing at you?"
Genesis,42,2,"He said, Behold, I have heard that there is food [<b>grain</b>] for sale in Egypt. Go down there and buy for us from there, so that we will live and not die."
Genesis,42,3,Yoseif’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Binyamin, Yoseif’s brother, Yaakov did not send along with his brothers, for he [Yaakov] said, Misfortune [<b>Death</b>] might befall him."
Genesis,42,5,"The sons of Yisrael came to buy [<b>grain</b>] among the others who came, for there was famine in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,6,Yoseif was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold [<b>grain</b>] to all the people of the land. Yoseif’s brothers came and they prostrated themselves to him with their faces to the ground.
Genesis,42,7,"Yoseif saw his brothers and he recognized them, but he acted like a stranger [<b>considered what he should say</b>] to them. He spoke harshly to them, and said to them, Where did you come from? They said, From the land of Canaan to buy food [<b>grain</b>]."
Genesis,42,8,"Yoseif recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"Yoseif recalled the dreams that he had dreamt about them, and said to them, You are spies. You have come to see where the land is exposed [<b>the defective part of the land</b>]."
Genesis,42,10,"They said to him, No my master. Your servants have come to buy food [<b>grain</b>]."
Genesis,42,11,We are all the sons of one man. We are honest [men]. Your servants have never been spies.
Genesis,42,12,"He said to them, No, You have come to see where the land is exposed [<b>the defective part of the land</b>]."
Genesis,42,13,"They said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. Behold the youngest one is this day with our father, and one is no more."
Genesis,42,14,"Yoseif said to them, That is just what I said to you, saying: you are spies."
Genesis,42,15,"You shall be tested in this manner. By Pharaoh’s life, you shall not leave from here unless your youngest brother comes here."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you and let him bring your brother. You will remain locked up and your words will be tested whether there is [<b>you speak</b>] any truth with you. If not, by Pharaoh’s life, you are spies."
Genesis,42,17,He [then] put them together in prison for three days.
Genesis,42,18,"Yoseif said to them on the third day, Do this and live. [<b>From before God</b>] I fear God."
Genesis,42,19,"If you are honest, one of your brothers will be imprisoned in your place of guarding, and you [the others] go bring food for your famished [<b>grain that is lacking in your</b>] households."
Genesis,42,20,"Bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words will be verified, and you will not die. They decided to do so."
Genesis,42,21,"They said to one another, In truth, we are guilty regarding our brother. We saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us and we did not listen [<b>obey him</b>]. That is why this trouble has come upon us."
Genesis,42,22,"Reuvein answered them saying, Did I not say to you to the following: Do not sin against the lad, but you did not listen [<b>obey</b>]; and now his blood is being avenged."
Genesis,42,23,"They did not know that Yoseif listened [understood], because the interpreter was between them."
Genesis,42,24,"He turned away from them and cried. He returned to them and spoke to them. He took Shimon from them, and had him bound before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"Yoseif gave orders—and their vessels were filled with grain, and each one’s money was replaced in his sack; and they were given provisions for the journey. This is what he did for them."
Genesis,42,26,They placed their purchases of grain on their donkeys and they departed from there.
Genesis,42,27,"The one opened his sack, to feed his donkey where they stayed overnight, and he saw his money, for behold it was in the opening of his bag."
Genesis,42,28,"He said to his brothers. My money has been returned, and behold it is also in my bag. [<b>The understanding of their</b>] Their hearts failed [<b>left</b>] them and they trembled, saying one to another, What is this that Elohim has done to us?"
Genesis,42,29,"They came to their father Yaakov, to the land of Canaan, and they told him all that had happened to them, saying,"
Genesis,42,30,"The man, the master of the land spoke to us harshly; and considered us as spies of the land."
Genesis,42,31,"We said to him, We are honest people, we have never been spies."
Genesis,42,32,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our [the same] father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,33,"The man, the master of the land, said to us, This is how I shall know that you are honest. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take food for your famished [<b>grain that is lacking in your</b>] households and go."
Genesis,42,34,"Bring your youngest brother to me, and then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. I will return your brother to you, and you will [again] do business in the land."
Genesis,42,35,"They were emptying their sacks, and behold each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. They saw their bundles of money—they and their father and they were afraid."
Genesis,42,36,"Yaakov, their father, said to them, You have deprived me of children; Yoseif is no more [<b>not here</b>], Shimon is no more, and you would take Binyamin: All this has happened to me."
Genesis,42,37,"Reuvein spoke to his father saying, Put my two sons to death if I do not bring him [Binyamin] back to you. Give him into my hands, and I will return him to you."
Genesis,42,38,"He [Yaakov] said, My son will not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and only he remains. Should misfortune [<b>death</b>] befall him on the way you are going, you will bring my white head down to the grave in sorrow."
Genesis,43,1,The famine was severe in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"When they had finished eating [<b>entirely comsumed</b>] the food [<b>grain</b>] that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go back and buy a little food [<b>grain</b>] for us."
Genesis,43,3,"Yehudah spoke to him saying, The man warned us repeatedly, saying, You had better not see my face unless your brother is with you."
Genesis,43,4,"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food [<b>grain</b>] for you."
Genesis,43,5,"But if you will not send [him] we will not go down; for the man said to us, You had better not see my face unless your brother is with you."
Genesis,43,6,"Yisrael said, Why did you do such harm to me, by telling the man that you had another brother."
Genesis,43,7,"They said, The man asked us repeatedly, about ourselves and about our family, saying. Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother? We told him according to his words. Could we have known that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
Genesis,43,8,"Yehudah said to his father, Yisrael, Send the lad with me, and we will get up and go; let us live and not die, we, you and our children."
Genesis,43,9,"I will be security for him. You will demand him from my hand. If I do not bring him to you, and set him before you, I will have sinned [<b>be a sinner</b>] to you for all time."
Genesis,43,10,"If we had not hesitated until now, we could have been there and back twice."
Genesis,43,11,"Their father Yisrael said to them, If so, here, this is what you must do: Take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and take an offering to the man, a little balsam, a little honey, gum, labdanum, pistachios and almonds."
Genesis,43,12,Take double the money in your hands; and the money that was returned in the opening of your bags return by your own hands. Perhaps it was an oversight.
Genesis,43,13,"Take your brother, get up and return to the man."
Genesis,43,14,"May the Almighty, Shaddai, grant you compassion in the presence of the man, that he may release to you your other brother along with Binyamin. If I have been bereft of my children, I will be bereft."
Genesis,43,15,"The men took that offering, and they took double money in their hands, and [they took] Binyamin. They rose and went down to Egypt, and they stood before Yoseif."
Genesis,43,16,"When Yoseif saw Binyamin with them he said to the one in charge of his house, Bring these men to the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for these men shall dine with me at noon [<b>the morning meal</b>]."
Genesis,43,17,"The man did as Yoseif said, and the man brought the men to the house of Yoseif."
Genesis,43,18,"The men were afraid because they had been brought to Yoseif’s house, and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our bags previously are we being brought [here]; that he may turn on [<b>act as a lord over</b>] us and come down on [<b>libel</b>] us, and take [<b>acquire</b>] us for slaves along with [<b>and take</b>] our donkeys."
Genesis,43,19,"They approached the man, who was in charge of Yoseif’s house, and they spoke to him at the entrance to the house."
Genesis,43,20,"They said, Please, my master, we came down the first time to buy food [<b>grain</b>]."
Genesis,43,21,"When we came to the inn and opened our bags, behold each man’s money was in the opening of his bag. It was our own money in its full weight. We have brought it back in our hand."
Genesis,43,22,We have [also] brought other money in our hand to buy food [<b>grain</b>]. We do not know who put the money in our bags.
Genesis,43,23,"He [the man] said, Peace be with you, do not fear. Your God, and the God of your fathers, has given you a hidden gift in your bags. Your money has come to me. He then brought Shimon out to them."
Genesis,43,24,The man brought the men into the house of Yoseif. He gave them water and they washed their feet. He had feed given to their donkeys.
Genesis,43,25,"They prepared their offering [to be ready] when Yoseif came at noon [<b>to the morning meal</b>], for they had heard that they would eat there."
Genesis,43,26,"Yoseif came to the house, and they brought the offering that was in their hand, to him in the house. They prostrated themselves on the ground to him."
Genesis,43,27,"He inquired about their welfare, and said, Is your old father at peace, the one about whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
Genesis,43,28,"They said, Your servant, our father is at peace. He is still alive. They bowed their heads and prostrated themselves."
Genesis,43,29,"He raised his eyes and saw his brother Binyamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me? He [then] said, Elohim be gracious to you [<b>Graciousness from before Elohim be upon you</b>] my son."
Genesis,43,30,"Yoseif hurried [to go out] because his compassion was aroused toward his brother, and he wanted to weep. He went into [his] [<b>bed</b>]room and wept there."
Genesis,43,31,"He washed his face and came out. He composed himself, and said, Serve bread."
Genesis,43,32,"They set [a place] for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, since the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, because it was loathsome to the [<b>the animal that the</b>] Egyptians [<b>worship, the Hebrews eat</b>]."
Genesis,43,33,"They were seated [<b>reclined</b>] before him, the first born [the oldest] according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. The men looked at each other in astonishment."
Genesis,43,34,He had portions carried from before him to [<b>before</b>] them. Binyomin’s portions was greater than all of their’s—five times as much. They drank with him and became intoxicated.
Genesis,44,1,"He commanded the one in charge of his house, saying, Fill the men’s bags with as much food [<b>grain</b>] as they can carry, and place each man’s money in the opening of his bag."
Genesis,44,2,"And my goblet, the silver goblet, put in the opening of the youngest one’s bag, together with the money for his purchase of food. He acted according to the word Yoseif had spoken."
Genesis,44,3,"With the morning light, the men were sent [on their way] together with their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4,"They had just left the city, they had not gone far, when Yoseif said to the one in charge of his house, Get up, pursue the men, and when you catch up with them, say to them, Why did you repay good with evil."
Genesis,44,5,"Why, this is [the goblet] from which my master drinks. He uses it for divination [<b>investigating</b>]. You have acted badly in what you have done."
Genesis,44,6,"He caught up with them, and spoke these exact words to them."
Genesis,44,7,"They said to him, Why does my master speak such words? It would be degrading for your servants to do [<b>May your servants be spared from doing</b>] such a thing."
Genesis,44,8,"Behold the money that we found in the opening of our bags, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we have stolen silver [<b>vessels</b>] or gold [<b>vessels</b>] from your master’s house?"
Genesis,44,9,"He among your servants with whom it is found, he shall die. We will also be servants to my master."
Genesis,44,10,"And he said, Your words are now also correct. The one with whom it is found, he shall be my slave, and you shall be guiltless."
Genesis,44,11,"They hurried, and each man lowered his bag to the ground, and each man opened his bag."
Genesis,44,12,"He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending with the youngest. The goblet was found in Binyomin’s bag."
Genesis,44,13,"They tore their garments [in grief]. Each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"Yehudah and his brothers came to Yoseif’s house. He was still there, and they fell to the ground before him."
Genesis,44,15,"Yoseif said to them, What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me is an expert diviner [<b>investigator</b>]?"
Genesis,44,16,"Yehudah said, What shall we say to my master? What can we speak? How can we justify ourselves? [<b>From before</b>] God [<b>the iniquity of your servants</b>] has [<b>been</b>] found the iniquity of your servants. Let us be slaves to my master, both we, and the one in whose hand the goblet was found."
Genesis,44,17,"He [Yoseif] said [to them], It would be degrading for me to do [<b>May I be spared from doing</b>] such a thing. The man in whose hand the goblet was found, he shall be my slave, and [the rest of] you go up in peace to your father."
Genesis,44,18,"Yehudah approached him [Yoseif] and said, Please my master, let your servant speak [<b>now</b>] a word in my master’s ears [<b>before my master</b>], and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh."
Genesis,44,19,"My master asked his servants, saying, Do you have a father or brother?"
Genesis,44,20,"We said to my master, We have a father who is old, and a young child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone survives of his mother, and his father loves him."
Genesis,44,21,"You said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him."
Genesis,44,22,"We said to my master, the lad cannot leave his father, for if he left his father, he would die."
Genesis,44,23,"You [then] said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you shall not see my face again."
Genesis,44,24,"When we went to your servant, my father, we told him of my master’s words."
Genesis,44,25,"Our father said, Go back and buy us a little food [<b>grain</b>]."
Genesis,44,26,"We said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, we will go down, for we cannot see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us."
Genesis,44,27,"Your servant, my father said to us, You know that my wife [Rochel] bore me two sons."
Genesis,44,28,"One has [already] left me, and I said, surely he is torn to pieces [<b>dead</b>]. I have not see him until now."
Genesis,44,29,"If you take this one also away from me, and misfortune [<b>death</b>] befall him, you will bring my white head down to the grave in evil."
Genesis,44,30,"And now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the lad is not with us; his soul is bound up with the lad’s [<b>as beloved to him as his own</b>] soul."
Genesis,44,31,"When he sees that the lad is not [with us], he will die. Your servants will have brought down the white head of your servant, our father, to the grave in sorrow."
Genesis,44,32,"For your servant became surety for the lad, to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, I will have sinned [<b>be a sinner</b>] to my father for all time."
Genesis,44,33,"And now, let your servant [<b>now</b>] remain as a slave to my master instead of the lad. Let the lad go up with his brothers."
Genesis,44,34,For how shall I go up to my father when the lad is not with me; lest I see the evil that would befall my father.
Genesis,45,1,"Yoseif could not contain his emotions in the presence of all who stood before him, and he cried out Let everyone leave my presence. No man remained with him, when Yoseif made himself known to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"He wept aloud, and the Egyptians heard about it, and the [<b>people of the</b>] house of Pharaoh [also] heard."
Genesis,45,3,"Yoseif said to his brothers, I am Yoseif, is my father still alive? His brothers could not answer [<b>a word to</b>] him for they were shocked at his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"[Then] Yoseif said to his brothers, Please [<b>Now</b>] come close to me. They came close [to him] and he said, I am Yoseif your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,"Now do not worry, and do not be angry with yourselves that you sold me here; for it was to preserve life that Elohim sent me [here] before you."
Genesis,45,6,For it is [now] two years that there has been famine in the land; and for another five years there will be no plowing [<b>sowing</b>] or harvest.
Genesis,45,7,"Elohim sent me [here] before you to insure your survival in the land, and to keep you alive for a great deliverance."
Genesis,45,8,"Now [then] it was not you that sent me here, but [<b>it was from before</b>] Elohim; and He has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and master of all [<b>the people of</b>] his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Hurry, go up to my father and tell him: this is what your son, Yoseif, says, Elohim has made me master of all Egypt. Come down to me, do not delay."
Genesis,45,10,"You will dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be close to me—you, your children, your grandchildren, your sheep, your cattle and all that you own."
Genesis,45,11,"I will provide for you there, since there will be another five years of famine; lest you become impoverished together with [<b>the people of</b>] your household and all that is yours."
Genesis,45,12,"Behold, your eyes see it along with my brother Binyomin’s eyes, that I speak to you with my own mouth [<b>in your language</b>]."
Genesis,45,13,"Tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and all that you saw. Hurry and bring my father down here."
Genesis,45,14,"He [then] fell upon his brother Binyomin’s neck and wept, and Binyomin wept upon his neck."
Genesis,45,15,He kissed all his brothers and wept upon [their necks]. After that his brothers spoke with him.
Genesis,45,16,The news was heard in Pharaoh’s house that Yoseif’s brothers had come. This was good [news] in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
Genesis,45,17,"Pharaoh said to Yoseif, Tell your brothers to do this: load up your beasts, and go and enter [<b>bring to</b>] the land of Canaan."
Genesis,45,18,Bring your father and [<b>the people of</b>] your households and come to me; and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt. You will eat of the fat of the land.
Genesis,45,19,Now you are commanded [to order (your) brothers to] do the following: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives. Bring your father and come.
Genesis,45,20,"Do not be concerned with your belongings, for the best of Egypt is yours,"
Genesis,45,21,"The sons of Yisrael did so. Yoseif gave them wagons by order of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey."

Genesis,45,25,"They went up from Egypt, and they came to the land of Canaan, to their father Yaakov."
Genesis,45,26,"They told him saying, Yoseif is still alive, and he is ruler of all the land of Egypt. His [Yaakov’s] heart stood still [<b>The words created uncertainty in his heart</b>], for he could not believe them."
Genesis,45,27,"They told him all the words of Yoseif which he had spoken to them, and he saw the wagons that Yoseif had sent to carry him. [Then] the spirit of [<b>prophecy rested upon</b>] their father Yaakov was revived."
Genesis,45,28,"Yisrael said, It is too much [<b>There is great joy for me</b>]! My son Yoseif still lives. I will go and see him before I die."
Genesis,46,1,"Yisrael journeyed with all that he possessed, and he came to Beer Sheva. He offered sacrifices [there] to the God of his father Yitzchok."

Genesis,47,14,"Yoseif gathered up all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, through the purchases [<b>grain</b>] they made. Yoseif brought the money to the house of Pharaoh."
Genesis,47,15,"When the money was used up in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all [the people of] Egypt came to Yoseif, saying, Give us bread; why should we die in your presence, [just] because there is no money?"

Genesis,47,19,"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land [in exchange] for bread. We and our land will become slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed grain, let us live and not die, and let the land not become desolate [<b>uncultivated</b>]."
Genesis,47,20,"Yoseif bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh’s [property.]"

Genesis,47,22,"But the land of the priests he did not buy, because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh. They ate the allotment that Pharaoh gave them, and therefore they did not sell their land."
Genesis,47,23,"Yoseif said to the people, Behold, I have today purchased you and your lands for Pharaoh. Here is seed, plant [it in] the soil."
Genesis,47,24,"When it produces [<b>the produce is gathered</b>] you must give a fifth to Pharaoh. Four parts shall be yours for seed for your fields and for your food, and for those [<b>the people</b>] of your households, and for food for your little ones."

Please [<b>Now</b>], do not bury me in Egypt."

Genesis,48,5,"And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you to Egypt, are mine. Ephraim and Menasheh, like Reuvein and Shimon, shall be mine [<b>before me</b>]."

Genesis,48,7,"And I, when I came from Padan, Rochel died unto me in the land of Canaan, on the road, when there was yet a stretch of land, before coming to Ephros. I buried her there on the road to Ephros, which is Beis Lechem."

Genesis,48,9,"Yoseif said to his father, These are my sons, whom Elohim has given me in this [place] [<b>here</b>]. He [Yaakov] said, Please Take [<b>Now bring</b>] them [<b>near</b>] to me, and I will bless them."

Exodus,4,11,"Adonoy said to him, “Who gave man a mouth, or who makes [a person] dumb or deaf? [Who makes a person] see or makes him blind? Is it not I—Adonoy?”"
Exodus,4,12,"Now go. I [<b>My Word</b>] will be with your mouth, and teach you what to say.”"
Exodus,4,13,"[Moshe] said, “I beg You Adony [my Master,] please [<b>now</b>] send the one You usually send [<b>who is fit to be sent</b>].”"
Exodus,4,14,"Adonoy displayed anger toward Moshe and said, “Is not Aharon, the Levite, your brother? I know [<b>It is revealed before Me</b>] that he knows how to speak. Behold he is setting out to meet you, and when he sees you he will rejoice in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"You will speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I [<b>My Word</b>] will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what to do."
Exodus,4,16,"He will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and you will be his master."
Exodus,4,17,"Take this rod in your hand, for with it you will perform the [miraculous] signs.”"
Exodus,4,18,"Moshe went and returned to Yeser, his father-in-law, and said to him, “I would like to leave [<b>now</b>] and return to my brothers in Egypt, to see if they are still alive.” Yisro said to Moshe, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"Adonoy said to Moshe in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt, for they have died—all the men who had sought your life [<b>to kill you</b>].”"
Exodus,4,20,"Moshe [then] took his wife and his sons, set them to ride on the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moshe took the rod of [<b>with which miracles had been carried out before</b>] God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “On your way back to Egypt, see [keep in mind] all the wondrous [signs] that I have placed in your hand, and do them before Pharaoh. I will harden his heart, and he will not send the people out."
Exodus,4,22,"You will say to Pharaoh, This is what Adonoy said, Yisroel is My son, My firstborn. "
Exodus,4,23,"And I have said to you, send out My son and let him serve [<b>before</b>] Me. If you refuse to send him, behold, I will slay your [own] firstborn son.”"
Exodus,4,24,"He [Moshe] was along the way, in the inn, [<b>an Angel of</b>] Adonoy confronted him, and wanted to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"Tzipporah took a flint-stone and cut off her son’s foreskin, and threw it at his feet [<b>brought it before him</b>], saying, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me [<b>With this blood of circumcision, a husband is given to us</b>].” "
Exodus,4,26,"He then withdrew from him [Moshe. Then she said, “[You are] a bridegroom of blood [to me] because of the circumcision [<b>Were it not for this blood of circumcision, my husband would have deserved to be killed</b>].”"
Exodus,4,27,"Adonoy said to Aharon, “Go meet Moshe in the desert.” He [Aharon] went and met him at the mountain [<b>upon which was revealed the Glory</b>] of God and he kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,Moshe told Aharon all the words of Adonoy with which He had sent him; and all the [miraculous] signs that He had commanded him [to demonstrate].
Exodus,4,29,Moshe and Aharon went [to Egypt] and they gathered all the elders of the B’nei Yisrael.
Exodus,4,30,"Aharon spoke all the words that Adonoy had spoken to Moshe, and he demonstrated the [miraculous] signs in the eyes [sight] of the people."
Exodus,4,31,"The people believed. When they heard that Adonoy was mindful of the B’nei Yisrael, and that He had seen their suffering [<b>was revealed before Him</b>], they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves."
Exodus,5,1,"Afterwards Moshe and Aharon went and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Adonoy, God of Yisrael said, ‘Send My people, so they may celebrate a festival to [<b>before</b>] Me in the wilderness.”"
Exodus,5,2,"Pharaoh said, “Who is [<b>The Name of</b>] Adonoy [<b>is not revealed to me</b>] that I should obey his voice [<b>Word</b>], to let Yisrael go. I do not know [<b>The Name of</b>] Adonoy [<b>is not revealed to me</b>], nor will I let [the B’nei] Yisrael go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"They said [to him], “The God of the Hebrews has revealed Himself to us. Please [<b>Now</b>] allow us to take a three day journey into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, our God, lest He strike us with the plague or with the sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"The king of Egypt said to them, “Why, Moshe and Aharon, are you distracting the people from their work? Get back to your burdens.”"
Exodus,5,5,"Then Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you want them to take leave from their hard work.”"
Exodus,5,6,"That day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,"
Exodus,5,7,"“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks as before. Let them go gather [their own] straw,"
Exodus,5,8,"[And] the quota of bricks that they made before, you shall place upon them; do not reduce it, for they are lazy and therefore they cry out, saying, ‘We want to go sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,"Make the workload heavier on the men, and make them do it. Let them not talk about [<b>be occupied with</b>] false ideas.”"
Exodus,5,10,"They went out—the taskmasters of the people and their officers—and spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh said, ‘I will no longer give you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"You must go get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your workload must not be reduced.’”"
Exodus,5,12,The people spread out all over Egypt to gather grain-chaff for straw.
Exodus,5,13,"The taskmasters pressured them saying, “You must complete your daily work [quota], just as [<b>you did</b>] [before] when there was straw [<b>given to you</b>].”"
Exodus,5,14,"The officers of the B’nei Yisrael were beaten—those whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had appointed—and were told, “Why have you not completed your quotas of brick making as you did yesterday and before neither yesterday, nor today?”"
Exodus,5,15,"The officers of the B’nei Yisrael came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying “Why are you doing this to your slaves?"
Exodus,5,16,"Your slaves are not given straw, and yet we are told to make bricks. Your slaves are beaten, and it is a sin for your people [<b>sin against them</b>].”"
Exodus,5,17,"He said, “You are lazy, therefore you say, ‘Let us go sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.’"
Exodus,5,18,"Now go, get to work. You will not be given straw, and you must deliver your quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"The officers of the B’nei Yisrael realized their bad position, saying, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,20,They met Moshe and Aharon who were waiting to meet them as they were leaving Pharaoh.
Exodus,5,21,"They said to them [Moshe and Aharon], “Let Adonoy look at [<b>become revealed to</b>] you and judge [<b>take revenge</b>]. You have made our aroma abhorrent in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, putting a sword in their hands to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"Moshe returned to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and said, “My Master. Why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You send me?"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your Name, he has done harm to this people; and You have not rescued Your people.”"
Exodus,6,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by [My] strong hand he will let them go, and by [a] strong hand, he will drive them out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,2,"Elohim spoke to Moshe and said to him, “I am Adonoy."
Exodus,6,3,"I revealed Myself to Avraham, to Yitzchok, and to Yaakov as Almighty Shaddai, but My Name Adonoy I did not make known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojourning where they lived as strangers."
Exodus,6,5,"And also [<b>before Me</b>] I have heard the groaning of the B’nei Yisrael, that the Egyptians are enslaving them, [<b>has been heard before Me</b>] and I have remembered My covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"Therefore say to the B’nei Yisrael, ‘I am Adonoy. I will bring you out from under [<b>amongst</b>] the [<b>heavy</b>] burdens of Egypt [<b>the Egyptians</b>], and I will save you from their slavery. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with acts of great judgments."
Exodus,6,7,"I will take [<b>bring</b>] you to Myself [<b>before Me</b>] as a people, and I will be to you Elohim. You will know that I am Adonoy, your God Who is bringing you out from under [<b>amongst</b>] the [<b>heavy</b>] burdens of Egypt."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you to the land regarding which I raised My hand [in oath] [<b>swore with My Word</b>] that I would give it to Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov, and I will give it to you as an inheritance. I am Adonoy.’”"
Exodus,6,9,"Moshe spoke [these words] to the B’nei Yisrael, but they would not listen to [<b>obey</b>] Moshe because of [their] shortness of wind and [<b>the</b>] hard labor [<b>that was hard upon them</b>]."
Exodus,6,10,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe saying,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Come, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he send the B’nei Yisrael out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,12,"Moshe spoke before Adonoy, saying, “Behold the B’nei Yisrael have not listened to [<b>obeyed</b>] me, how then will Pharaoh listen to [<b>accept</b>] me—I whose lips are covered [<b>am heavy of speech</b>].”"
Exodus,6,13,"Adonoy [then] spoke to Moshe and Aharon, commanding them regarding the B’nei Yisrael and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the B’nei Yisrael from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their paternal households: the sons of Reuvein, the first-born of Yisrael [are]: Chanoch, Pallu, Chetzron and Carmi. These are the families of Reuvein."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Shimon: Yemuel, Yamin, Ohad, Yachin, Tzochar and Shaul, the son of the Canaanite woman. These are the families of Shimon."
Exodus,6,16,"These are the names of the sons of Leivi, according to their generations: Gershon, Kehos, and Merari. The years of Leivi’s life were one hundred and thirty-seven years."
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Livni and Shimi, and their families [descending from them]."
Exodus,6,18,"The sons of Kehos: Amram, Yitzhar, Chevron and Uzziel. The years of Kehos’s life were one hundred and thirty-three years."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari: Machli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their [descending] generation.
Exodus,6,20,Amram took his aunt [<b>father’s sister</b>] Yocheved for his wife and she bore him Aharon and Moshe. The years of Amram’s life were one hundred and thirty-seven years.
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Yitzhar: Korach, Nefeg and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel: Mishaeil, Eltzaphan and Sisri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aharon took Elisheva, daughter of Aminadav, sister of Nachshon, for a wife, and she bore him Nadav, Avihu, Elazar and Isamar. "
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korach: Assir, Elkanah and Aviasaf. These are the families of the Korachites."
Exodus,6,25,"Elazar, son of Aharon took, for himself one of the daughters of Putieil, for a wife, and she bore him Pinchas. These are the heads of the Levites’ patriarchs according to their families."
Exodus,6,26,"This is [the lineage of] Aharon and Moshe to whom Adonoy had said, “Bring the B’nei Yisrael out of the land of Egypt with their multitudes.”"
Exodus,6,27,"They are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the B’nei Yisrael out of Egypt. These are Moshe and Aharon."
Exodus,6,28,It was the day when Adonoy spoke to Moshe in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,6,29,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe saying, “I am Adonoy. Speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I am speaking to you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"Moshe said before Adonoy, “Behold, I have covered lips [<b>am heavy of speech</b>]. How will Pharaoh listen to [<b>accept</b>] me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “See, I have made [<b>appointed</b>] you a god [<b>master</b>] to Pharaoh, and Aharon, your brother will be your spokesman."
Exodus,7,2,"You will speak all that I command you and Aharon, your brother, will speak to Pharaoh, that he send the B’nei Yisrael out of his land."
Exodus,7,3,"I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, [in order to] increase My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,4,"[Thus] Pharaoh will not listen to [<b>accept</b>] you. But then I will display My hand [<b>the blow of My power</b>] against Egypt, and I will bring My multitude, My people, the B’nei Yisrael out of the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment."
Exodus,7,5,Egypt will then know that I am Adonoy when I send forth My hand [<b>the blow of My power</b>] over Egypt and bring out the B’nei Yisrael from among them.”
Exodus,7,6,Moshe and Aharon did so. They did exactly as Adonoy commanded them.
Exodus,7,7,Moshe was eighty years old and Aharon was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,"Adonoy said to Moshe and Aharon, saying:"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Give yourselves [credibility by displaying] a marvel;’ you [Moshe] should then say to Aharon, ‘Take your rod and throw it down before Pharaoh.’ It will become a serpent.’”"
Exodus,7,10,Moshe and Aharon came to Pharaoh and they did exactly as Adonoy commanded [them]. Aharon threw his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent.
Exodus,7,11,Pharaoh too called [his] wise men and magicians. The sorcerers of Egypt also did likewise with their magic art.
Exodus,7,12,"When each man threw down his rod they (the rods) became serpents, and Aharon’s rod swallowed their rods."
Exodus,7,13,"Pharaoh’s heart [remained] hard and he did not listen to [<b>accept</b>] them, just as Adonoy had foretold."
Exodus,7,14,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Pharaoh’s heart is heavy [unmoved]. He refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water, and stand there to meet him by the bank of the river. The rod that was turned into a snake, take in your hand."
Exodus,7,16,"Say to him, “Adonoy, God of the Hebrews, sent me to you to say [to you], ‘Send out My people that they may worship [<b>before</b>] Me in the wilderness. Behold, thus far you have not listened [<b>accepted</b>]."
Exodus,7,17,"This is what Adonoy has said, ‘By this you will know that I am Adonoy. Behold, with the rod that is in my hand, I will strike the water of the river and it will turn into blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish that is in the river will die, and the river will become polluted. The Egyptians will weary themselves [trying to purify] drinking water from the river.’”"
Exodus,7,19,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Say to Aharon, ‘Take your rod and extend your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, over their canals, over their lakes, and over every place where their water is gathered, and it [the water] will become blood. There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, [even] in [vessels] of wood and [vessels] of stone.”"
Exodus,7,20,"Moshe and Aharon did exactly as Adonoy commanded them. He [Aharon] lifted the rod and struck the water in the river before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his [Pharaoh’s] servants, and all the water of the river turned into blood."
Exodus,7,21,"The fish that were in the river died, and the river became so polluted that the Egyptians were unable to drink the water from the river. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"The sorcerers of Egypt did likewise with their magic art. Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened and he did not listen to [<b>accept</b>] them, just as Adonoy had spoken."
Exodus,7,23,"Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and paid no attention even to this [miracle]."
Exodus,7,24,"The Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink, for they could not drink from the waters of the river."
Exodus,7,25,Seven full days [passed] after Adonoy had struck the river.
Exodus,7,26,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what Adonoy has said, “Send out my people so they may worship [<b>before</b>] Me."
Exodus,7,27,"If you refuse to send [them,] behold I will plague [<b>smite</b>] all your borders [territories] with frogs."
Exodus,7,28,"The river will swarm with frogs. They will emerge and come into your house, into your bedroom, and on your bed, into the houses of your servants and your people, into your ovens and into your kneading bowls."
Exodus,7,29,Upon you and upon your people and upon all your servants the frogs will emerge.
Exodus,8,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Say to Aharon, ‘Extend your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams and over the lakes, and bring up the frogs upon the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,2,"Aharon extended his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frog emerged and covered the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,8,3,"The sorcerers did likewise with their magic art, and made the frogs emerge upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,4,"Pharaoh called for Moshe and Aharon and said, “Pray to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, and let Him remove the frogs from me and from my people, and I will send the people to sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.”"
Exodus,8,5,"Moshe said to Pharaoh, “Glorify [<b>Request might for</b>] yourself at my expense. [Exactly for] when shall I [<b>Give me a time when I shall</b>] pray for you, and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and from your houses, remaining only in the river.”"
Exodus,8,6,"[Pharaoh] said, “By tomorrow.” [Moshe] said, “As you say. You will then know that there is none like Adonoy, our God."
Exodus,8,7,"The frogs will be removed from you, from your houses, from your servants and from your people. They will remain only in the river."
Exodus,8,8,"Moshe and Aharon left Pharaoh, and Moshe cried out to [<b>prayed before</b>] Adonoy concerning the frogs that He had set upon Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,9,"Adonoy did as Moshe said, the frogs died, [those that were in] the houses, the courtyards, and the fields."
Exodus,8,10,"They gathered them into [many] heaps, and the land was [<b>they became</b>] polluted [<b>decayed upon the land</b>]."
Exodus,8,11,"[When] Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and did not listen to [<b>accept</b>] them, just as Adonoy had spoken."
Exodus,8,12,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Say to Aharon, Extend your rod and strike the dust of the earth; and it will turn into lice throughout the whole land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,8,13,"They did so. Aharon extended his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and there was lice on man and beast. All the dust of the earth turned into lice throughout the whole land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,14,"The sorcerers did likewise with their magic art. They tried to bring forth lice but they could not, and there were lice on man and beast."
Exodus,8,15,"The sorcerers said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of [<b>a plague from before</b>] Elohim;” but Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened and he did not listen to [<b>accept</b>] them, as Adonoy had spoken."
Exodus,8,16,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Rise up early in the morning and set yourself before Pharaoh, when he goes out to the water, and say to him, ‘This is what Adonoy has said, ‘Send out My people so they may worship [<b>before</b>] Me."
Exodus,8,17,"For if you do not send out My people, behold, I will send against you and your servants, and your nation, and your houses, swarms of wild animals. The houses of Egypt will be full of the wild animals, and so too the ground upon which they stand."
Exodus,8,18,"On that day, I will set apart the land of Goshen upon which My people stand [dwell], so that there will not be any wild animals there, so that you will know that I am Adonoy [<b>who rules</b>] in the midst of the earth."
Exodus,8,19,I will set a [sign of] deliverance (distinction) between [<b>for</b>] My people and between [<b>but upon</b>] your people [<b>I will bring a plague</b>]. This sign will take place tomorrow.”
Exodus,8,20,Adonoy did so. Huge throngs of wild animals came to the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants. Throughout the whole land of Egypt the land was devastated by the wild animals.
Exodus,8,21,"Pharaoh called for Moshe and Aharon, and he said, “Go! Sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] your God [here] in the land.”"
Exodus,8,22,"Moshe said, “It would not be proper to do so. For that which is abominable [sacred] to Egypt we intend to sacrifice to [<b>the animal that the Egyptians worship we are taking to sacrifice before</b>] Adonoy, our God. Could we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes and not have them stone us? [<b>Behold, we will sacrifice the animal that the Egyptians worship, and they will see. Will they not want to stone us?</b>]"
Exodus,8,23,"We must make a three day trip into the wilderness, and sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, our God, in the manner that He will tell us.”"
Exodus,8,24,"Pharaoh, said, “I will send you out so that you may sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, your God in the wilderness, as long as you do not go too far away. Pray [<b>also</b>] for me.”"
Exodus,8,25,"Moshe said, “Behold, when I leave your presence I will pray to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, and the wild animals will depart from Pharaoh, and from his servants and from his people, tomorrow. But let Pharaoh never again deceive us [by] refusing to send the people to sacrifice to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.”"
Exodus,8,26,Moshe went out from Pharaoh[’s presence] and prayed to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Exodus,8,27,Adonoy did as Moshe spoke [requested]. He caused the wild animals to depart from Pharaoh from his servants and from his people. Not a single one remained.
Exodus,8,28,"But Pharaoh hardened his heart again, this time and he did not send out the people."
Exodus,9,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what Adonoy, God of the Hebrews has said, Send out My people and let them serve [<b>before</b>] Me."
Exodus,9,2,"For if you refuse to send them out, and continue holding them;"
Exodus,9,3,"behold, the hand of [<b>a plague from before</b>] Adonoy is directed at your livestock that are in the field—upon the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the cattle and the sheep—there will be a very heavy [serious] plague."
Exodus,9,4,Adonoy will distinguish between the livestock of the [B’nei] Yisrael and the livestock of Egypt. None belonging to the B’nei Yisrael will die.’”
Exodus,9,5,"Adonoy has set a time, saying, Tomorrow Adonoy will do this thing in the land."
Exodus,9,6,"Adonoy did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock in Egypt died, but of the livestock of the B’nei Yisrael, not one died."
Exodus,9,7,Pharaoh sent [scouts] and behold not a single animal of the B’nei Yisrael died. The heart of Pharaoh remained hard and he did not send out the people.
Exodus,9,8,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe and Aharon, “Both of you take full handfuls of furnace soot and let Moshe throw it heavenward before the eyes of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,It will become a fine dust [and settle] over the whole land of Egypt. It will settle on man and beast causing a rash which will break out into boils [affecting] the whole land of Egypt.”
Exodus,9,10,"They took the furnace soot and stood before Pharaoh. Moshe threw it heavenward, and it caused a rash which broke into boils in man and beast."
Exodus,9,11,"The sorcerers could not stand before Moshe as a result of the rash, for the rash affected the sorcerers as well as all of Egypt."
Exodus,9,12,Adonoy caused Pharaoh’s heart to remain hard and he did not listen to [<b>accept</b>] them just as Adonoy had spoken to Moshe.
Exodus,9,13,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘This is what Adonoy, God of the Hebrews, has said, “Send out My people and let them serve [<b>before</b>] Me."
Exodus,9,14,"For this time, I will send all My plagues against your [very] heart. [They will strike] your servants and your people, so that you will know that there is none like Me[<b>, a ruler</b>] in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"For now [<b>had I wanted to</b>] I [could] have extended My hand [<b>sent the plague of My strength</b>], and struck you and your people with the pestilence, and you would have been obliterated from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"Nevertheless, for this reason I have let you survive—to show you My strength—so that [<b>the strength of</b>] My Name will be declared throughout all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,But you are still oppressing My people refusing to send them out.
Exodus,9,18,"Tomorrow at this time, I will cause it to rain [<b>down</b>] a tremendously heavy hail. There was never anything like it in Egypt, from the time it was founded until now."
Exodus,9,19,Now send [word] and gather [shelter] your livestock and all that you have in the field. Any man or beast that is found [remains] in the field and will not be brought into the house [indoors]—the hail will descend upon them and they will die.”
Exodus,9,20,"He that feared the word of Adonoy among Pharaoh’s servants, made [<b>gathered</b>] his servants and his livestock flee into the houses [indoors]."
Exodus,9,21,"But he whose heart did not heed the word of Adonoy, left his servants and his livestock in the field."
Exodus,9,22,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Extend your hand toward the heavens, and there will be hail throughout the land of Egypt—on man and on beast, and upon all the vegetation in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"Moshe extended his rod toward the heavens, and Adonoy sent thunder and hail, and fire came streaming down upon the earth. Adonoy caused it to rain hail on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,There was hail and fire [lightning] flashing among the hailstones. It was an extremely heavy [downfall]. There had never been anything like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus,9,25,"The hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, [killing] all that was in the field [outdoors]—both man and beast. All the vegetation in the fields was struck by the hail and every tree in the fields was shattered."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen where the B’nei Yisrael were, there was no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"Pharaoh sent, and called for Moshe and Aharon, and he said to them, “This time I have sinned. Adonoy is the righteous One and I and my people are the sinners."
Exodus,9,28,"Pray to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy [<b>for there is much relief before Him, so that there will be no thunders of anger like these upon us from before God, nor hail.</b>] There has been enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will send you out without further delay.”"
Exodus,9,29,"Moshe said to him, “When I leave the city, I will spread my hands [<b>in prayer</b>] to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. The thunder will cease and their will be no more hail, so that you will know that the earth belongs to Adonoy."
Exodus,9,30,"But regarding you and your servants, I know that you are not yet in fear of [<b>humbled from before</b>] Adonoy, Elohim."
Exodus,9,31,"The flax and barley have been broken since the barley was ripe, and the flax had formed into stalks."
Exodus,9,32,But neither the wheat or the spelt were broken since they are late in sprouting.”
Exodus,9,33,"Moshe [then] left Pharaoh’s presence, and left the city. He spread his hands [in prayer] to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. The thunder ceased, and the hail and the rain [<b>which had descended</b>] did not reach the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"[When] Pharaoh saw that the rain, and the hail and the thunder ceased, he continued his sin[ful ways]. He and his servants hardened their hearts."
Exodus,9,35,"Pharaoh’s heart was strengthened, and he did not send the B’nei Yisrael out. This was just as Adonoy had spoken through Moshe."
Exodus,10,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Go in to Pharaoh for I have hardened his heart and [also] the hearts of his servants, so that I will be able to set [perform] these [miraculous] signs in their midst."
Exodus,10,2,"And so that you may relate in the ears of [<b>before</b>] your son and grandson how I made a mockery of the Egyptians [<b>the miracles that I performed in Egypt</b>], and the miraculous signs I performed among them. You will then know that I am Adonoy.”"
Exodus,10,3,"Moshe and Aharon went in to Pharaoh and they said to him, “This is what Adonoy, God of the Hebrews, has said, ‘How long will you refuse to be humbled before Me? Send My people out that they may worship [<b>before</b>] Me."
Exodus,10,4,"For if you refuse to send My people out, I will bring locusts within your borders tomorrow."
Exodus,10,5,"They will cover the visible surface [<b>eye of the sun</b>] of the land so that one will be unable to see the land. They will eat all that was spared, that remained for you from the hail, and they will eat every tree that grows for you in the field."
Exodus,10,6,"They will fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians. [It will be something] that was never seen by your fathers or your fathers’ fathers since the day they were on the earth until this day.’” He [Moshe] then turned and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this [man] be a menace to us? Send these men out and let them worship Adonoy, their God. Did you not yet realize that Egypt is [being] destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"Moshe and Aharon were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go worship [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, your God. Exactly who will be going?”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moshe said, “With our young and with our old we will go. With our sons, with our daughters, with our sheep and with our cattle we will go, for it is a festival to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy for all of us.”"
Exodus,10,10,"He [Pharaoh] said to them, “So be it. May [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy be with you [<b>your support</b>] just as I will send you and your little ones. Beware for evil confronts you [<b>the evil which you intend to commit will be turned against your faces</b>]."
Exodus,10,11,This is not right. [Only] the [adult] men should go and worship [<b>before</b>] Adonoy for this is what you desire.” He had them expelled from Pharaoh’s presence.
Exodus,10,12,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts [to bring the locusts] and they will emerge upon the land of Egypt. They will eat all the vegetation in the land, that remained from [the destruction of] the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,Moshe stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt and Adonoy directed an east wind over the land all that day and all the night. When morning came the east wind had carried [brought] the locusts.
Exodus,10,14,"The locusts came up over the whole land of Egypt, and rested [settled] within all the borders of Egypt. It was very severe. Never before had there been such locusts and never again after them."
Exodus,10,15,"They covered the visible surface [<b>eye of the sun</b>] of the entire land so that the land was darkened. They ate all the vegetation of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that was left [spared] by the hail. No greenery remained on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in the entire land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moshe and Aharon, and he said, “I have sinned to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, your God, and to you."
Exodus,10,17,"Now forgive my sin just this one time and plead with [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, your God, just to remove this death from me.”"
Exodus,10,18,He [Moshe] left Pharaoh’s presence and prayed to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Exodus,10,19,"Adonoy turned a very strong westerly wind, that carried away the locusts, and plunged them into the Reed Sea. Not a single locust remained in all of Egypt’s borders."
Exodus,10,20,"Adonoy hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not send out the B’nei Yisrael."
Exodus,10,21,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt [<b>after the darkness of the night will be removed</b>]. The darkness will be tangible.”"
Exodus,10,22,"Moshe stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was total darkness in the entire land of Egypt for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"Man could not see his fellow man, nor could anyone rise from his place for three days. But all the B’nei Yisrael had light in their dwellings."
Exodus,10,24,"Pharaoh called to Moshe, and he said, “Go! Worship [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. Just let your sheep and cattle stay behind. Even your little ones can go with you.” "
Exodus,10,25,"Moshe said, “You too will give us sacrifices and burnt-offerings that we will make [offer] to [<b>before</b>] our God."
Exodus,10,26,Our own flocks will also go with us. Not a single hoof [<b>thing</b>] will remain. We must take from them to worship [<b>before</b>] Adonoy our God; since we do not know with what [animals] we will worship [<b>before</b>] Adonoy until we get there.”
Exodus,10,27,Adonoy hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he was [no longer] willing to send them away.
Exodus,10,28,Pharaoh said to him [Moshe] “Leave my presence. Beware! Do not see my face again; for on the day you see my face you will die.”
Exodus,10,29,"Moshe said, “As you say. [<b>You have spoken well.</b>] I will not see your face again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “There is one more plague that I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. After that he will send you away from here. When he sends you away, he will actually drive you out from here completely."
Exodus,11,2,"Speak, please [<b>now</b>], in the ears of [<b>before</b>] the people, and let each man request [borrow] from his friend, and each woman from her friend, articles of silver and articles of gold.”"
Exodus,11,3,"Adonoy gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moshe too was very great in the land of Egypt, [both] in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people."
Exodus,11,4,"Moshe said, “This is what Adonoy has said, About the time of midnight, I will go out [<b>become revealed</b>] in the midst of Egypt."
Exodus,11,5,"Every first-born in the land of Egypt will die, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting on his [<b>who is destined to sit upon the</b>] throne [<b>of his kingdom</b>], to the first-born of the [Egyptian] slave girl, behind the mill-stones, and every first-born animal."
Exodus,11,6,"There will be a great cry [of anguish] throughout the entire land of Egypt, the likes of which there never was and like there never will be."
Exodus,11,7,"But among all the B’nei Yisrael, a dog will not sharpen [<b>cause damage with</b>] its tongue [growl] at man or animal. You will then know that Adonoy distinguishes between Egypt and Yisrael."
Exodus,11,8,"Then all these, your servants, will come down to me, and prostrate themselves [<b>beseech me</b>] saying, ‘Go! You and all the people that follow you [<b>that are with you</b>]. Then I will go out.” He [Moshe] then left Pharaoh in great anger."
Exodus,11,9,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Pharaoh will not listen to [<b>accept</b>] you. Thus I will multiply My wonders in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,Moshe and Aharon had done all these wonders before Pharaoh. [However] Adonoy hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he did not send the B’nei Yisrael out of his land.
Exodus,12,1,Adonoy said to Moshe and Aharon in the land of Egypt saying:
Exodus,12,2,“This month shall be [reckoned] to you [as] the head [beginning] of months. It shall be to you the first of the months of the year.
Exodus,12,3,"Speak to the entire community of Israel saying, ‘On the tenth [day] of this month they shall take—each man [shall take] a lamb for [his] family, a lamb for each household."
Exodus,12,4,"If the [members of the] household are too few for the [<b>numbering of the</b>] [eating of a] lamb then he shall take [a lamb] [together] with his neighbor, close by his house, according to the number of individuals. According to what the person eats shall you make your count regarding the lamb."
Exodus,12,5,"A flawless lamb, a yearling male must be in your possession. You may take it from sheep or goats."
Exodus,12,6,"You shall hold it in safekeeping until the fourteenth day of this month, they shall slaughter it—the entire community of Yisrael—between evenings [in the afternoon]."
Exodus,12,7,They shall take of its blood and place it on the side of the doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they will eat [the lamb].
Exodus,12,8,They shall eat the meat during this night. It shall be roasted over fire. They shall eat it with matzos [<b>matzoh</b>] and bitter herbs.
Exodus,12,9,"You must not eat it half-cooked or [<b>even</b>] boiled in water, but only roasted over fire, its head with its knees and its inner organs."
Exodus,12,10,You must not leave any of it over until morning. Any of it left over until morning must be burned in fire.
Exodus,12,11,"This is how you must eat it: with your waist belted, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You must eat it in haste, it is a Pesach-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."
Exodus,12,12,"I will pass through [<b>become revealed in</b>] the land of Egypt on that night, and I will strike [kill] every first-born in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgments, I am Adonoy."
Exodus,12,13,The blood will be for you as a sign on the houses where you are [staying]. I will see the blood and I will pass over [<b>have mercy upon</b>] you. There will be no plague against you when I strike the land of Egypt.
Exodus,12,14,"This day shall be for you a [day of] remembrance. You shall celebrate it as a festival to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, throughout your generations. It is an eternal statute that you must celebrate it."
Exodus,12,15,"You must eat matzos [<b>matzoh</b>] for seven days, but before the first day you must remove [<b>nullify</b>] [all] leaven from your homes; for anyone who eats chametz, that soul will be cut off from Yisrael. [Chametz is forbidden] from the first day [of Pesach] until [after] the seventh day."
Exodus,12,16,"The first day shall be a holy assembly and the seventh day shall be a holy assembly to you. No work shall be done on them, only for [the preparation of food] which will be eaten by every person, that alone may be done for you."
Exodus,12,17,"You must be vigilant regarding the matzos [<b>matzoh</b>], for on this very day I brought out your hosts from the land of Egypt. You must preserve this day for your generations, it is an eternal statute."
Exodus,12,18,"In the first [month] [<b>Nisan</b>] on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening you shall eat matzos [<b>matzoh</b>]; until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening."
Exodus,12,19,"For seven days leaven may not be found in your homes, for whoever eats chametz that soul shall be cut off from the community of Israel, whether a proselyte or a native born in the land."
Exodus,12,20,You must not eat anything that is chametz. In all your dwellings you shall eat matzos [<b>matzoh</b>].
Exodus,12,21,"Moshe called to all the elders of Yisrael, and he said to them, “Draw [from your flocks] or purchase for yourselves a lamb for your families and slaughter it as a Pesach offering."
Exodus,12,22,"Take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin. Touch [<b>Sprinkle</b>] the lintel and the two side [door] posts with some of the blood in the basin. And all of you, let no man go out the door of his house until morning."
Exodus,12,23,Adonoy will pass through [<b>become revealed</b>] to plague the Egyptians and He will see the blood on the lintel and on the two side [door] posts. Adonoy will then pass over [<b>have mercy upon</b>] that door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to plague you.
Exodus,12,24,You must preserve this [ritual] as a statute for you and your children forever.
Exodus,12,25,"When you come to the land that Adonoy will give to you, as He spoke, you must preserve this service."
Exodus,12,26,"When your children will ask you, “What is this service of yours?”"
Exodus,12,27,"You shall say, “It is the Pesach-offering [<b>of compassion</b>] to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy Who passed over [<b>had mercy upon</b>] the houses of the B’nei Yisrael in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and saved our homes. The people then bowed and prostrated themselves."
Exodus,12,28,The B’nei Yisrael went and did as Adonoy commanded Moshe and Aharon. They [also] did so.
Exodus,12,29,"It was [exactly] midnight and Adonoy struck down [killed] every first-born son in the land of Egypt, from the first-born son of Pharaoh sitting on his [<b>who is destined to sit upon the</b>] throne [<b>of his kingdom</b>], to the first-born son of the captive [prisoner] who was in the dungeon, as well as every first-born animal."
Exodus,12,30,"Pharaoh arose at night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no house where there were no dead."
Exodus,12,31,"[Pharaoh] called for Moshe and Aharon that night and said, “Set out! Get out from among my people, both you and the B’nei Yisrael. Go worship [<b>before</b>] Adonoy as you have said [requested]."
Exodus,12,32,"Take your sheep and cattle too, as you have said and go; bless [<b>pray for</b>] me too."
Exodus,12,33,"The Egyptians pressed the people to hurry them—to send them out of the land, for they said, “We are all dead men.”"
Exodus,12,34,"The people took their dough before it was leavened. Their [<b>The</b>] leftovers [<b>of their dough</b>] were wrapped in their clothing, [and carried] on their shoulders."
Exodus,12,35,"The B’nei Yisrael did as Moshe said, and they requested of the Egyptians silver articles and gold articles and clothing."
Exodus,12,36,"Adonoy granted the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they granted their request. They [B’nei Yisrael thus] drained Egypt of its wealth."
Exodus,12,37,The B’nei Yisrael traveled from Ramseis to Sukkos. There were about six hundred thousand males on foot besides the children.
Exodus,12,38,"A great mixture [of nationalities] [<b>multitude of strangers</b>] also went up with them. There were [also] sheep and cattle, a huge amount of livestock."
Exodus,12,39,"They baked the dough that they had brought out of Egypt into matzoh cakes, for it was not leavened. Since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, they had also not prepared provisions for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,The habitation of the B’nei Yisrael living in Egypt lasted four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus,12,41,"It was at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, and on that very day all of Adonoy’s multitudes went out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"This was a night of vigil for [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. This night remains a night of vigil to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy for all the B’nei Yisrael for [all] their generations."
Exodus,12,43,"Adonoy said to Moshe and Aharon, “This is the statute of the Pesach offering: No alien [<b>Jew who renounces his religion</b>] may eat it."
Exodus,12,44,"However each man’s slave [if he was]purchased with money, you must circumcise him and then he may eat it."
Exodus,12,45,An [alien] sojourner or hired worker may not eat it.
Exodus,12,46,"It must be eaten in one house [<b>group</b>]. You must not remove from the house any of its flesh, to the outdoors, and you must not break any of its bones."
Exodus,12,47,The entire community of Yisrael must make this [offering].
Exodus,12,48,"When a proselyte dwells with you and wants to make the Pesach-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, every male must be circumcised. He may then come near [join] to make it, and be like the native born. But no uncircumcised male may eat of it."
Exodus,12,49,There shall be one law for the native born and for the proselyte who dwells among you.
Exodus,12,50,All the B’nei Yisrael did as Adonoy commanded Moshe and Aharon. They [Moshe and Aharon] also did so.
Exodus,12,51,"On that very day, Adonoy took the B’nei Yisrael out of Egypt in their multitudes."
Exodus,13,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Sanctify to [<b>before</b>] Me all the first-born, that [is the first to] open the womb among the B’nei Yisrael, both of man and beast, it is Mine.”"
Exodus,13,3,"Moshe said to the people, “Remember this day [as the day] on which you came out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out from this. You must not eat chametz."
Exodus,13,4,"On this day you went out, in the month of Aviv [Nissan]."
Exodus,13,5,"When Adonoy brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Chittites, the Emorites, the Chivites and the Yevusites, which He swore to your fathers [that He would] give to you—a land flowing with [<b>producing</b>] milk and honey—you must conduct this service in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"For seven days you must eat matzos [<b>the matzoh</b>], and the seventh day is a festival to Adonoy."
Exodus,13,7,"Matzos [<b>Matzoh</b>] must be eaten these seven days. No chametz may be seen in your possession, and no leaven may be seen in all your boundaries."
Exodus,13,8,"You must tell your son [child] on that day saying, ‘Because of this, Adonoy did [this] for me when I came out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"It shall be to you as a sign on your hand, and for a reminder between your eyes, so that Adonoy’s teachings will be in your mouth, for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,"You must preserve this statute in its appointed time, from year to year."
Exodus,13,11,When Adonoy brings you to the land of the Canaanites as He swore to you and to your fathers; and He will have given it to you.
Exodus,13,12,"[At that time] you must pass on, [set aside] every one that [is first to] open the womb, to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. Every firstling that is dropped [born] by animals that belong to you, the males shall belong to [<b>be consecrated before</b>] Adonoy."
Exodus,13,13,"Redeem each firstling donkey with a sheep. If it is not redeemed, you must break its neck. Redeem every first-born male among your sons."
Exodus,13,14,"When your son asks you at a later time saying ‘What is this?’ You should say to him, “With a strong hand Adonoy brought us out of Egypt from the house of slavery."
Exodus,13,15,"When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to send us out, Adonoy killed every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man to the first-born of beast. I am therefore sacrificing to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy all that [is first to] open the womb which are male, and the first-born of my sons I redeem.’"
Exodus,13,16,"[These words] shall be a sign on your hand and for totafos [<b>phylacteries</b>] between your eyes, for with a strong hand Adonoy brought us out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,17,"When Pharaoh sent away the people Elohim did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines because it was the shortest route; for Elohim said, “The people might change their minds [<b>tremble </b>] should they encounter war, and return to Egypt."
Exodus,13,18,"And so Elohim led the people round-about by way of the Reed Sea Desert, and the B’nei Yisrael went up armed from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,13,19,"Moshe took [<b>carried up</b>] the bones of Yoseif with him, for [Yoseif] had bound the B’nei Yisrael by oath saying, “Elohim will surely remember you, and [then] you must carry up my bones out of here with you."
Exodus,13,20,They journeyed from Sukkos and camped at Eisom at the edge of the desert.
Exodus,13,21,"Adonoy went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and at night in a pillar of fire to provide them with light, so that they could travel by day and by night."
Exodus,13,22,"He did not remove the pillar of cloud by day, or [<b>even</b>] the pillar of fire at night, from before the people."
Exodus,14,1,Adonoy spoke to Moshe saying:
Exodus,14,2,"“Speak to the B’nei Yisrael and have them turn back and camp before Pi haChiros, between Migdol and the sea, facing Ba’al Tzephon. Camp opposite it, near the sea.”"
Exodus,14,3,"Pharaoh will then say of the B’nei Yisrael, “They are confused in the land, the desert has shut [trapped] them in."
Exodus,14,4,I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and he will pursue them. and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and his entire army. Egypt will [then] know that I am Adonoy.” They [the B’nei Yisrael] did just that.
Exodus,14,5,"The king of Egypt was told that the people had fled [<b>gone</b>]. Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart regarding the people, and they said, “What have we done? [How did] we release Israel from serving us?"
Exodus,14,6,He [Pharaoh] harnessed his chariot and he took his people with him.
Exodus,14,7,"He took six hundred elite chariots [and crews], and all the [other] chariots of Egypt, and commanders [<b>mighty men were appointed</b>] over all of them."
Exodus,14,8,"Adonoy hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued the B’nei Yisrael. The B’nei Yisrael went out high handedly [in triumph] [<b>publicly</b>]."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptians pursued them and overtook them as they were encamped by the sea. There were all Pharaoh’s chariot horses, his cavalry and his army [infantry], at Pi haChiros, facing Ba’al Tzephon."
Exodus,14,10,"Pharaoh drew near, and the B’nei Yisrael looked up, and beheld the Egyptians coming after them. They were very frightened, and the B’nei Yisrael cried out to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."
Exodus,14,11,"They said to Moshe, “Were there not enough graves in Egypt that you took us out to die in the desert? What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"This is the [exact] thing that we told you in Egypt saying, ‘Leave us alone and let us serve the Egyptians.’ It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than we should die in the desert.”"
Exodus,14,13,"Moshe said to the people, “Do not be afraid, stand firm and you will see the deliverance of Adonoy, which He will perform for you this day, for the Egyptians you have seen this day you will never again see them, even to eternity."
Exodus,14,14,"Adonoy will fight [<b>the war</b>] for you, and you [must] remain silent."
Exodus,14,15,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Why do you cry to Me? [<b>I have accepted your prayer.</b>] Speak to the B’nei Yisrael and let them move on."
Exodus,14,16,"And you [do as follows], raise your staff and extend your hand over the sea and split it. The B’nei Yisrael will then come [across] in the midst of the sea on dry land."
Exodus,14,17,"I will harden the heart of the Egyptians and they will follow after them. I will be glorified through Pharaoh and his entire army, his chariots and his cavalry."
Exodus,14,18,"The Egyptians will know that I am Adonoy when I am glorified through Pharaoh, his chariots and cavalry."
Exodus,14,19,"The angel of Elohim moved [from its position] when it traveled in front of the camp of Israel, and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and it stood behind them."
Exodus,14,20,It came between the Egyptian camp and the camp of Yisrael. There was the cloud and darkness [for the Egyptians] and [the pillar of fire] lit up the night [<b>for Yisrael</b>]. The camps did not approach each other all that night.
Exodus,14,21,"Moshe extended his hand over the sea and Adonoy turned back the sea with a strong east wind [blowing] all through the night. He made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided."
Exodus,14,22,"The B’nei Yisrael went into the midst of the sea on dry land. The waters were like a wall [<b>walls</b>] to them, to their right and to their left."
Exodus,14,23,"The Egyptians pursued and followed them—all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his cavalry—into the middle of the sea."
Exodus,14,24,"It was the morning watch [the end of the night] Adonoy gazed down at the Egyptians camp through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He caused panic in the Egyptian camp."
Exodus,14,25,"He removed the wheels of their chariots and made them move heavily [clumsily]. The Egyptians said, “Let us flee the [B’nei] Yisrael, for [<b>this is the might of</b>] Adonoy [<b>that</b>] is fighting [<b>wars</b>] for them against Egypt.”"
Exodus,14,26,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Extend your hand over the sea, and the water will come back over the Egyptians, [over] their chariots and their cavalry.”"
Exodus,14,27,"Moshe extended his hand over the sea, and, toward morning, the sea returned to its strength while the Egyptians were fleeing toward it. Adonoy overturned [<b>stirred</b>] the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The waters returned and covered the chariots, and the cavalry, including Pharaoh’s entire army which had followed them into the sea. Not one of them remained [alive]."
Exodus,14,29,The B’nei Yisrael walked on dry land in the midst of the sea. For them the waters were a wall [<b>walls</b>] to their right and to their left.
Exodus,14,30,On that day Adonoy delivered [B’nei] Yisrael from the hand of Egypt. [B’nei] Yisrael saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
Exodus,14,31,"[B’nei] Yisrael saw the [<b>might of the</b>] great hand which Adonoy wielded against Egypt. The people feared [<b>from before</b>] Adonoy, and believed in [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy and [that] [<b>in the prophecy of</b>] Moshe [was] His servant."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moshe and the B’nei Yisrael sang this song to [<b>exalted this praise before</b>] Adonoy and they said, I [<b>We</b>] will sing to [<b>praise and we will give thanks before</b>] Adonoy for He is most high [<b>exalted Himself above those who are exalted, and exaltation is His</b>], horse and its rider He threw into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,The strength and retribution [<b>The awesomeness</b>] of God [<b>is my strength and my praise</b>] was the cause of my deliverance. [<b>He said with His Word and He has been a savior for me.</b>] This is my Almighty and I will glorify [<b>build a Temple for</b>] Him; the God of my father and I will exalt [<b>worship before</b>] Him.
Exodus,15,3,"Adonoy is the master of [<b>victory of</b>] war[<b>s</b>], Adonoy is His Name."
Exodus,15,4,Pharaoh’s chariots and army He hurled into the sea; his elite officers were sunk in the Reed Sea.
Exodus,15,5,"The depths covered them, they sank into the shadowy depths like stone."
Exodus,15,6,"Your right hand Adonoy, is adorned with power, Your right hand Adonoy, crushes the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,"In Your great majesty [<b>might</b>], You destroy [<b>crush</b>] Your opponents [<b>those who rise up against Your people</b>]; You send forth Your fury, it consumes them like [<b>fire consumes</b>] straw."
Exodus,15,8,"Through the wind [breath] of Your nostrils [<b>Word of Your mouth</b>], the waters were heaped up [<b>became wise</b>], flowing water stood like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea."
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy [<b>had</b>] said, “I will pursue [them], I will overtake [them], I will divide the spoils, I will satisfy myself [<b>My soul will be satisfied from them</b>]; I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.”"
Exodus,15,10,"You made Your wind blow [<b>said with Your Word</b>], the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"Who is like You among the mighty, Adonoy! Who is like You, adorned in holiness, Awesome in praise, doing wonders? [<b>There is none besides You, for You are God, Adonoy! There is none besides You, O God, You are adorned in holiness, Awesome in praise, doing wonders!</b>]"
Exodus,15,12,"You extended Your right hand, the earth swallowed them."
Exodus,15,13,In Your kindliness [<b>goodness</b>] You led the people [<b>who</b>] You redeemed; with Your might You guided [<b>carried</b>] them to Your holy dwelling place.
Exodus,15,14,"Peoples heard and they tremble, terror gripped the inhabitants of [<b>those who inhabited</b>] Philistia."
Exodus,15,15,"Then the chiefs of Edom panicked, the mighty men of Moav were seized with trembling; all the inhabitants of [<b>those who inhabited</b>] Canaan melted away [<b>were crushed</b>]."
Exodus,15,16,"Horror and dread [<b>will</b>] fall upon them, at the greatness of Your arm [<b>power</b>], they [<b>will be</b>] are still [<b>silent</b>] as stone; until Your people [<b>will</b>] cross over [<b>the stream of Arnon</b>], Adonoy, until Your [<b>this</b>] people [<b>who</b>] You acquired [<b>redeemed will</b>] cross over [<b>the Jordan</b>]."
Exodus,15,17,"You will bring them and plant them [<b>cause them to dwell</b>] on the mountain of Your inheritance, the place [<b>prepared</b>] for [<b>the house of</b>] Your habitation [<b>Shechina</b>], which You, Adonoy have made [<b>established</b>]; the Sanctuary—my Master—[which] Your hands established."
Exodus,15,18,"Adonoy will reign[<b>, His kingdom is established</b>] forever and ever."
Exodus,15,19,"When Pharaoh came with his horse and chariot and his cavalry into the sea, Adonoy returned the waters of the sea on them; and the B’nei Yisrael walked on dry land in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,15,20,"Miriam the prophetess, sister of Aharon, took the drum in her hand; and all the women followed her with drums and dancing."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam led them in the response: “Sing to [<b>Praise and give thanks before</b>] Adonoy for He is most high [<b>exalted Himself above those who are exalted, and exaltation is His</b>]; horse and its rider He hurled into the sea.”"
Exodus,15,22,"Moshe led [B’nei] Yisrael away from the Reed Sea, and they went out into the desert of Shur [<b>Cheger</b>], they traveled for three days in the desert and they did not find any water."
Exodus,15,23,They came to Marah but they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter. The place was therefore called Marah [bitter].
Exodus,15,24,"The people complained to Moshe saying, “What shall we drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"He [Moshe] cried out to [<b>prayed before</b>] Adonoy, Adonoy showed him [<b>instructed him concerning</b>] a tree and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet [<b>pleasing</b>]. There He set before [<b>established for</b>] them statutes and ordinances, and there He tested them."
Exodus,15,26,"He said [to them,] “If you vigilantly obey the voice [<b>Word</b>] of Adonoy, your God, and do what is upright in His eyes [<b>before Him</b>], give ear to His commandments, and preserve all His statutes; [then], every sickness that I brought upon Egypt, I will not bring upon you, for I am Adonoy, Who heals you."
Exodus,15,27,"Then they came to Eilim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms. and they camped the by the water."
Exodus,16,1,"They journeyed from Eilim, and the entire community of the B’nei Yisrael came to the desert of Sin, which is between Eilim and Sinai. It was the fifteenth day of the second month after they went out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,The entire community of the B’nei Yisrael complained against Moshe and Aharon in the desert.
Exodus,16,3,"The B’nei Yisrael said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out to this desert to cause this entire congregation to die of starvation.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Behold, I will make bread rain [<b>come down</b>] from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather enough for each day, that I may test them [to see] if they will walk in [the way of] My teaching or not."
Exodus,16,5,"On the sixth day [when] they prepare what they bring [home], it will be twice as much as they gather every [other] day.”"
Exodus,16,6,"Moshe and Aharon said to all the B’nei Yisrael, “In the evening you will know that [it is] Adonoy [Who] brought you out from the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,16,7,"And in the morning you will see the glory of Adonoy, for He has heard your complaints [<b>are heard (before Him)</b>] against [<b>regarding the Word of</b>] Adonoy. But what are we that you cause complaints against us?”"
Exodus,16,8,"[Then] Moshe said, “When Adonoy gives you meat to eat in the evening, and a filling meal of bread in the morning, Adonoy will have heard your complaints [<b>will have been heard before Adonoy</b>], that you cause complaints against Him. What are we? Your complaints are not against us but against [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moshe said to Aharon, “Say to the entire community of the B’nei Yisrael: Come near before Adonoy, for He has heard your complaints [<b>have been heard before Him</b>].”"
Exodus,16,10,"As Aharon spoke to the entire community of the B’nei Yisrael, they turned toward to the desert, and behold the glory of Adonoy was visible [<b>revealed</b>] in the cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe saying,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the complaints of the B’nei Yisrael [<b>have been heard before Me</b>]. Speak to them saying, ‘Between evenings [afternoon] you will eat meat, and in the morning you will have your fill of bread, and you will know that I am Adonoy, your God."
Exodus,16,13,It was evening and quails rose up and covered the camp. In the morning there was a layer of dew [<b>descended</b>] around the camp.
Exodus,16,14,"The layer of dew [<b>that had fallen</b>] had risen, and behold, on the surface of the desert were thin [uncovered] [<b>peeled away</b>] flakes. It was as fine as [<b>gir, like</b>] frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"The B’nei Yisrael saw it and said to one another, “It is a food,” for they did not know [exactly] what [kind] it was. Moshe said to them, “This is the bread that Adonoy is giving you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"This is what Adonoy has commanded: Each man shall gather his requirement of food. An omer per person, according to the number of your people. shall each man take for those in his tent.”"
Exodus,16,17,"The B’nei Yisrael did so. They gathered it, some more, some less."
Exodus,16,18,"However when they measured it with an omer, the one who had taken more had no extra, and the one who had taken less, was not lacking. They had gathered exactly enough for each one to eat."
Exodus,16,19,"Moshe said to them, “Let no man leave any over until morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"They did not listen to [<b>accept</b>] Moshe, and some men left some over until morning. It became wormy and putrid, and Moshe was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"They gathered it each morning, each man according to what he would eat. [When] the sun became hot [<b>on that which remained from it upon the face of the field</b>], it melted."
Exodus,16,22,"When the sixth day came, what they had gathered [was a] double [portion of] bread, two omers for each individual. All the leaders of the community came and told Moshe [about it]."
Exodus,16,23,"He said to them, “This is what Adonoy has said: Tomorrow is a [day of] rest, Adonoy’s [<b>a</b>] holy Shabbos [<b>before Adonoy</b>]. Bake what you want to bake, and cook what you want to cook, and whatever is left over, put aside for yourselves, to preserve it until the morning.”"
Exodus,16,24,They put it aside until morning as Moshe had commanded. It did not turn putrid and there were no worms in it.
Exodus,16,25,"Moshe said, “Eat it today, for today is Shabbos to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. Today you will not find it [manna] in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it, but the seventh day is Shabbos, there will be none on [that day].”"
Exodus,16,27,"When the seventh day came some of the people went out to gather, but they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My teachings.”"
Exodus,16,29,"See, because Adonoy gave you the Shabbos, therefore He gave you on the sixth day bread for two days. Every man must remain in his place. No man may go out of his place on the seventh day."
Exodus,16,30,The people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"The House of Yisrael named it [the food] man[na]. It was like white coriander seed, and it tasted like wafers in honey."
Exodus,16,32,"Moshe said, “This is what Adonoy has commanded: Fill an omer [measure] with it to preserve it for your generations. That they may see the bread with which I fed you in the desert when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,16,33,"Moshe said to Aharon, “Take a jar and put an omer full of manna in it, and place it before Adonoy to be preserved for your generations.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As Adonoy commanded Moshe, Aharon placed it before the Testimony for preservation."
Exodus,16,35,"The B’nei Yisrael ate the manna for forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,The omer is a tenth of an eiphoh [<b>which is three se’in</b>].
Exodus,17,1,"The entire community of B’nei Yisrael journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, traveling according to the word of Adonoy. They camped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"The people quarreled with Moshe, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moshe said to them, “Why are you quarreling with me? Why are you testing [<b>before</b>] Adonoy?”"
Exodus,17,3,"The people were suffering thirst for [the lack of] water, and the people complained against Moshe and said, “Why did you bring us up from Egypt—to kill me and my children, and my livestock with thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Moshe cried out to [<b>prayed before</b>] Adonoy saying, “What shall I do for this people? Before long they will stone me.”"
Exodus,17,5,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Pass to the front of the people and take with you the elders of the [B’nei] Yisrael. The staff with which you struck the river; take in to your hand, and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Choreiv. You shall strike the rock and water will come out of it, and the people [will be able] to drink. Moshe did this in the sight [presence] of the elders of the [B’nei] Yisrael."
Exodus,17,7,"He [Moshe] named the place Massah and Merivah because the B’nei Yisrael had quarreled [Merivah] and because they had tested [Massah] [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, saying, “Is [<b>the Shechina of</b>] Adonoy among us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,Amaleik came and fought [<b>a war</b>] with [B’nei] Yisrael in Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"Moshe said to Yehoshua, “Choose men for us and go out to battle [<b>fight a war with</b>] Amaleik. Tomorrow, I will stand on top of the hill with the staff [<b>with which miracles were performed from before</b>] of God in my hand.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Yehoshua did as Moshe told him—to battle [<b>fight a war with</b>] Amaleik. Moshe, Aharon and Chur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"When Moshe raised his hand, [<b>(the fighters) of the House of</b>] [B’nei] Yisrael prevailed; but when he let his hand down [to rest] [<b>(the fighters) of the House of</b>] Amaleik prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"Moshe’s hands became heavy. They took a stone and placed it under him and he sat upon it. Aharon and Chur supported his hands, one of them on one side and one on the other side. His hands remained an expression of faith [as he prayed] [<b>were spread in prayer</b>] until sunset."
Exodus,17,13,Yehoshua weakened [<b>crushed</b>] Amaleik and his people with the edge [<b>word</b>] of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Write this as a remembrance in the Book, [the Torah] and repeat it in [<b>before</b>] Yehoshua’s ears, for I will totally obliterate the memory of Amaleik from under the heavens."
Exodus,17,15,Moshe built an altar and called it [<b>worshiped on it before</b>] Adonoy nissi [Adonoy is my miracle] [<b>Who had performed miracles for him</b>].
Exodus,17,16,"He said [<b>with an oath, this saying from before the Awesome one, whose Shechina is upon His glorious throne, that in the future a war will be waged before God against the house of Amaleik to destroy them for generations forever.</b>] , “The hand is on God’s throne, Adonoy will be at war with Amaleik for all generations.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Yisro heard—priest [<b>minister</b>] of Midian, Moshe’s father-in-law—about all that Elohim had done for Moshe and for His people Yisrael, that Adonoy brought Yisrael out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"Moshe’s father-in-law, Yisro took Moshe’s wife, Tzipporah, after he had sent her back [home],"
Exodus,18,3,"along with her two sons. The name of one was Gershom, because he [Moshe] had said, “I was a stranger in an alien land.”"
Exodus,18,4,"The name of the [other] one was Eliezer, because the God of my father was my help, and rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh."
Exodus,18,5,"Moshe’s father-in-law, Yisro came, along with his [Moshe’s] sons, and wife, to Moshe, to the desert where he was camped near the mountain [<b>upon which the Glory</b>] of God [<b>was revealed</b>]."
Exodus,18,6,"He said to Moshe, “I, your father-in-law, Yisro, am coming to you along with your wife; her two sons are with her.”"
Exodus,18,7,"Moshe went out to greet his father-in-law. He prostrated himself and [then] kissed him. They asked after each other’s well being, and went into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"Moshe told his father-in-law all that Adonoy had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt for the sake of Yisrael; including all the hardship that had befallen them on the way, and [how] Adonoy had rescued them."
Exodus,18,9,Yisro rejoiced over all the good that Adonoy had done for Yisrael; that He had rescued them from the hand of Egypt.
Exodus,18,10,"Yisro said, “Blessed is Adonoy Who rescued you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of Pharaoh; Who rescued the people from under the hand [<b>domination</b>] of Egypt [<b>the Egyptians</b>]."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that Adonoy is greater than all the gods, [<b>great, and there is no god besides Him,</b>] because [<b>with</b>] the very thing [<b>through which the Egyptians</b>] they plotted [<b>to punish Yisrael</b>] came upon them [<b>they themselves were punished</b>].”"
Exodus,18,12,"[Then] Yisro, Moshe’s father-in-law, brought [<b>offered</b>] a burnt-offering and [peace]-offerings to [<b>before</b>] God. Aharon and all the elders of Yisrael came to eat bread with [Yisro,] Moshe’s father-in-law, before God."
Exodus,18,13,It was on the following day [that] Moshe sat to judge the people and the people stood around Moshe from morning until evening.
Exodus,18,14,"When Moshe’s father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting by yourself and [letting] the people stand around you from morning until evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"Moshe said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to seek [instruction from] God."
Exodus,18,16,"Whenever they have a problem, they come to me, and I judge between man and his neighbor. I impart to them God’s statutes and His laws.”"
Exodus,18,17,"Moshe’s father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good."
Exodus,18,18,"You are going to wear yourself out, you too and this people that is with you. This [activity] is too heavy for you. You cannot do it alone."
Exodus,18,19,"Now listen to my voice [<b>obey me</b>]. I will give you advice and [<b>the Word of</b>] God [<b>will</b>] be with you [<b>your support</b>]. You must be God’s representative [<b>ask instruction from before God</b>] for the people, and bring the[ir] problems to [<b>before</b>] God."
Exodus,18,20,"You shall enlighten them as to the statutes and laws, and impart to them the path in which they must walk, and the deeds they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"You must seek out from among all the people capable, God-fearing men, men of truth, who despise [<b>accepting</b>] gain. You must then appoint them over [the people] as officers of thousands, officers of hundreds, officers of fifties and officers of tens."
Exodus,18,22,"Let them [<b>They shall</b>] judge the people at all times. Every major problem they will bring to you, and every minor problem they shall judge by themselves. It will [thus] be easier for you since they will bear the burden with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this and God commands you [to do so], you will be able to survive, and also this entire people will come [<b>go</b>] to their place in peace.”"
Exodus,18,24,Moshe listened to [<b>accepted</b>] the voice [<b>word</b>] of his father-in-law and he did all that he said.
Exodus,18,25,"Moshe chose capable men from among all Yisrael, and appointed them leaders over the people; officers of thousands, officers of hundreds, officers of fifties and officers of tens."
Exodus,18,26,"They judged [<b>would judge</b>] the people at all times. The difficult problems, they would bring to Moshe, and the simple problems they would judge by themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"Moshe sent his father-in-law off, and he [Yisro] went on his way to his land."
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month of the Bnei Yisrael’s departure from the land of Egypt, on that very day they came to the desert of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"They had journeyed from Rephidim and had come to the desert of Sinai, and camped in the desert. Yisrael camped there opposite the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"Moshe went up to [<b>before</b>] [the Presence of] God, and Adonoy called to him from the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall say to the House of Yaakov, and tell to the Bnei Yisrael."
Exodus,19,4,"‘You saw what I did to Egypt; and [how] I carried [<b>transported</b>] you [<b>as if</b>] on wings of eagles, and brought you [<b>close</b>] to Me [<b>My worship</b>]."
Exodus,19,5,"And now if you listen diligently [<b>obey</b>] to My voice [<b>Word</b>], and preserve My covenant; you shall be [<b>more</b>] beloved before Me than My special treasure among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine."
Exodus,19,6,"You will be to [<b>before</b>] Me a kingdom of [<b>kings and</b>] kohanim, and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the Bnei Yisrael.”"
Exodus,19,7,Moshe came [back] and called for the elders of the people. He presented to them all these words which Adonoy had commanded him.
Exodus,19,8,"All the people responded in unison, and said, “All that Adonoy has spoke, we will do.” Moshe brought the words of the people to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."
Exodus,19,9,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Behold, I will come [<b>become revealed</b>] to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak to you, and they will also believe in you forever.” Moshe told Adonoy the words of the people [<b>before (Adonoy)</b>]."
Exodus,19,10,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Go to the people, and sanctify [prepare] them today and tomorrow, and let them cleanse their clothing."
Exodus,19,11,"Let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day, Adonoy will descend [<b>become revealed</b>] on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."
Exodus,19,12,"Set bounds for the people around [the mountain], saying [to them], ‘Be careful not to go up the mountain, or [even] to touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will be put to death."
Exodus,19,13,"Do not touch him [with your] hand, for he will be stoned or cast down. Neither man or beast will be allowed to live. When the [ram’s] horn is sounded with a long blast, they will [then] be permitted to go up on the mountain.”"
Exodus,19,14,"Moshe went down from the mountain to the people. He sanctified the people, and they immersed [<b>washed</b>] [themselves and] their clothing."
Exodus,19,15,"He said to the people, “Be ready by the end of three days. Do not come near a woman."
Exodus,19,16,"It was on the third day, in the morning, that there was thunder and lightning. A heavy cloud was on the mountain, and there was a very loud sound of the shofar. All the people in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,"Moshe brought the people toward [the Divine Presence of] [<b>the Word of</b>] God, [leading them] out of the camp. They stood at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"The entire Mount Sinai was enveloped with smoke, for Adonoy had descended [<b>become revealed</b>] upon it in fire. Its smoke rose like the smoke of a [lime] furnace and the entire mountain trembled violently."
Exodus,19,19,The sound of the shofar grew louder and louder. Moshe spoke and [<b>from before</b>] God responded to him [<b>he was answered</b>] with [His] voice.
Exodus,19,20,"Adonoy descended [<b>became revealed</b>] on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and Adonoy called to Moshe to come up to the top of the mountain, and Moshe went up."
Exodus,19,21,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Go down and warn the people lest they break through [the boundary] toward [<b>before</b>] [the Presence of] Adonoy in order to see; and many [of them] will die."
Exodus,19,22,"Even the kohanim who [usually] come near to [<b>serve before</b>] Adonoy’s Presence, must be sanctified, lest Adonoy send destruction among [<b>kill</b>] them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"Moshe said to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, “The people can not go up to Mount Sinai, for You have warned us saying, ‘Set a boundary around the mountain and sanctify it.’”"
Exodus,19,24,"Adonoy said to him, “Go down. You will then come up [again], along with Aharon. The kohanim and the people, [however,] must not break through to go up toward [<b>before</b>] [the Presence of] Adonoy, lest He send destruction among [<b>kill</b>] them.”"
Exodus,19,25,"Moshe went down to the people, and he said [this] to them."
Exodus,20,1,"Elohim spoke all these words, saying:"
Exodus,20,2,"I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves [<b>slavery</b>]."
Exodus,20,3,You must not have any other gods before My Presence [<b>besides Me</b>].
Exodus,20,4,"You must not make for yourself any carved image, or picture of anything that is in the heaven above, or on the earth below, or in the water below the earth."
Exodus,20,5,"You must not prostrate yourself to them, and you must not worship them. For I, Adonoy your God, am a jealous Almighty. I am cognizant of the sins of fathers for [their] [<b>rebellious</b>] children, to the third and fourth [generations] of My enemies [<b>when the children complete the sinning after their fathers</b>]."
Exodus,20,6,But I do [acts of] loving kindness [<b>goodness</b>] for thousands [of generations] to those who love Me and preserve My commandments.
Exodus,20,7,"Do not take [<b>swear in</b>] the Name of Adonoy, your God in vain. For Adonoy will not acquit the one who takes [<b>swears in</b>] His Name in vain [<b>falsely</b>]."
Exodus,20,8,Remember the Shabbos day to sanctify it.
Exodus,20,9,"You may work six days, and do all your work."
Exodus,20,10,"But the seventh day is Shabbos to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, your God. You must not do any manner of work—you, your son, your daughter, your slave, your maid, your animal, and the foreigner within your gates."
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days Adonoy made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day. Therefore Adonoy blessed the Shabbos and made it holy."
Exodus,20,12,"Honor your father and your mother so that your days may be lengthened upon the land that Adonoy, your God, is giving you."
Exodus,20,13,Do not commit murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal [by kidnapping human beings]. Do not testify as a false witness [<b>testimony</b>] against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,14,"Do not covet your neighbor’s house. Do not covet your neighbor’s wife, his slave, his maid, his ox, his donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor."
Exodus,20,15,"All the people saw the sounds, the flames, the sound of the shofar, and the mountain emitting smoke. The people saw [all this] and they trembled, and stood far off."
Exodus,20,16,"They said to Moshe, “You speak to us and we will listen [<b>obey</b>]. Let [<b>it not be spoken to us from before</b>] Elohim not speak with us [anymore] lest we die.”"
Exodus,20,17,"Moshe said to the people, “Do not be afraid. It was to exalt [<b>test</b>] you that [<b>the Glory of</b>] Elohim [<b>became revealed to you</b>] came [in this manner], so that the fear of Him be on your faces that you not sin.”"
Exodus,20,18,The people stood far off. Moshe drew near to the dense cloud where [<b>the Glory of</b>] [the Divine Presence of] God was.
Exodus,20,19,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “This is what you must say to the Bnei Yisrael. ‘You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven."

Exodus,20,21,"Make an earthen altar for [<b>before</b>] Me and slaughter your burnt-offerings near it, your peace-offerings, your sheep and your cattle.

Exodus,20,22,"When you build a stone altar for [<b>before</b>] Me, do not build it out of hewn stone, lest you lift your sword on it, you will [therewith] have profaned it."
Exodus,20,23,"Do not go up to My altar with steps, so that your nakedness not be revealed on it.’”"
Exodus,21,1,And these are the laws that you shall set before them.
Exodus,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew slave [<b>who is a son of a Hebrew</b>], he shall serve [you] for six years, but in the seventh [year] he is to go out free, for naught [without liability]."
Exodus,21,3,"If he came by himself [unmarried], he shall go out by himself. If he was married, his wife shall go out with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master should give him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, then the woman and her children belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself."
Exodus,21,5,"If the slave explicitly says, “I have come to love my master, my wife and my children, I do not want to go out free.”"
Exodus,21,6,"His master must bring him to [<b>before</b>] the judges. He must then bring him next to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl. He then serves his master [<b>will be a working servant for him,</b>] forever."
Exodus,21,7,"If a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out [free] in the manner of male slaves."
Exodus,21,8,"If she is displeasing to her master, who had not designated [<b>for otherwise he would have designated</b>] her as his wife, he must allow her to be redeemed. He has no power [right] to sell her to an alien people [<b>another man</b>] for he has dealt deceitfully with [<b>controlled</b>] her."
Exodus,21,9,"If he has designated her as a wife for his son, he must grant her exactly the same rights as daughters [<b>of Yisrael</b>]."
Exodus,21,10,"If he takes himself another [wife], her sustenance, her clothing and her conjugal rights he must not diminish."
Exodus,21,11,"If he does not do these three things to her, she goes out free with no repayment of money."
Exodus,21,12,"If one strikes a man and he [the victim] dies, he shall be put to death."
Exodus,21,13,"But if he did not lie in wait [to ambush him] but [<b>from before</b>] God [<b>he was</b>] brought it to his hand, then I will designate for you a place, to which he can flee [and find refuge]."
Exodus,21,14,"But if a man plots against his neighbor to kill him intentionally, you may [even] take him from My altar to put him to death."
Exodus,21,15,Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"Whoever steals [kidnaps] a man [<b>person from B’nei Yisrael</b>] and sells him, if he is found in his hand, he shall be put to death."
Exodus,21,17,Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,"When men quarrel and one man hits his fellow with a stone or with [his] fist; and he [the victim] does not die but becomes bedridden [<b>falls to idleness</b>],"
Exodus,21,19,"If he gets up and is able to walk on the outside on his own power, the one who struck him shall be acquitted. Still he must pay for his loss of work, and must pay for his complete cure [<b>the doctor’s fee</b>]."
Exodus,21,20,"If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod [<b>power</b>], and [the slave] dies under his hand, [the death] must be avenged [<b>judged</b>]."

Exodus,32,8,"They have departed quickly from the way that I commanded them, they have made for themselves a molten calf. They have prostrated themselves to it and offered sacrifices to it, and have said, ‘These, Yisrael, are your gods who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,32,9,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “I have seen [observed] this people [<b>are revealed before Me</b>], and behold they are a stiff-necked people."
Exodus,32,10,Now leave Me alone [<b>leave your prayer from before Me</b>] and My wrath will blaze against them and destroy them. I will then make you into a great nation.”
Exodus,32,11,"Moshe implored [<b>prayed</b>] before the Presence of Adonoy, his God, and he said, “Adonoy! Why should Your wrath blaze against Your people whom You brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should Egypt be able to say, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in [<b>between</b>] the mountains, and to annihilate them from the face of the earth?’ Turn from [withdraw] Your blazing wrath, and reconsider the [intent of doing] evil to Your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Avraham, Yitzchok and Yisrael, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your Self [<b>Word</b>], and said to them, ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of the heaven; and all this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,Adonoy reconsidered the [intent of doing] evil that He had said He would do to His people.
Exodus,32,15,"Moshe turned and went down from the mountain with the two Tablets of the Testimony in his hand. They were tablets written on both sides, the writing was [visible] from either side."
Exodus,32,16,"The Tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the Tablets."
Exodus,32,17,"Yehoshua heard the voice of the people rejoicing, and he said to Moshe, “There is a sound of battle in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,"But he [Moshe] said, “It is not the sound of strength [song of victory] [<b>the mighty who are victorious in war</b>], nor is it the sound of weakness [song of defeat] [<b>the weak who are broken</b>]. It is a sound of song [<b>the rejoicers</b>] that I hear.”"
Exodus,32,19,"As he [Moshe] approached the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Moshe’s anger blazed, and he threw down the Tablets that were in his hands and smashed them beneath [<b>at the bottom of</b>] the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,"He took the calf that they had made, and burned it in fire, and ground it into fine powder. He then scattered it on the water, and made the B’nei Yisrael drink it. "
Exodus,32,21,"Moshe then said to Aharon, “What did this people do to you that you brought upon them such a great sin?”"
Exodus,32,22,"Aharon said, “Let not the wrath of my master blaze. You know that the people are set on evil."
Exodus,32,23,"They said to me, ‘Make gods for us that will lead us for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what happened to him.’"
Exodus,32,24,"I said to them, ‘Who has gold?’ They removed [their gold] and gave it to me. I threw it into the fire, and this calf emerged.”"
Exodus,32,25,"Moshe saw [the bad traits of] the people for they were [now] exposed [<b>rejected</b>]; for Aharon had allowed them to be exposed [<b>nullified them</b>], and now they would be disgraced among their adversaries [<b>to make them take a bad name for themselves for their generations</b>]."
Exodus,32,26,"Moshe stood at the entrance of the camp and said, “Whoever is for [<b>fears</b>] Adonoy, [come] to me.” All the sons of Leivi gathered to him."
Exodus,32,27,"He said to them, “This is what Adonoy, God of Yisrael has said, ‘Let each man put his sword on his hip and pass through from gate to gate in the camp. Let each man kill [even] his brother, each man his friend, each man his relative."
Exodus,32,28,"The sons of Leivi did as Moshe said. On that day those that fell from among the people, numbered approximately three thousand men."
Exodus,32,29,"Moshe said, “Consecrate yourselves [<b>Your hands have offered a sacrifice</b>] today to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy—for each man killed [even] his son and brothers—that He may bestow a blessing upon you today.”"
Exodus,32,30,"The next day Moshe said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, perhaps I will gain atonement for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"Moshe returned to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and said, “I beseech You! This people have committed a great sin and have made a god of gold."
Exodus,32,32,"Now if You would bear [forgive] their sin, and if not, blot me out from Your book that You have written.”"
Exodus,32,33,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Those who have sinned against [<b>before</b>] Me, I will blot out from My book."
Exodus,32,34,"And now, go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My angel will go before you. However on the day when I take account of them, I will take their sin into account."
Exodus,32,35,Adonoy then struck the people with a plague because they had made [worshiped] the calf that Aharon made.
Exodus,33,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, “Leave, go up from this [place]—you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt—to the land of which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzchok and to Yaakov, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’"
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Emorites, the Chitites, the Perizites, the Chivites, and the Yevusites."
Exodus,33,3,"[You will then] enter a land flowing with [<b>producing</b>] milk and honey. [I am sending an angel] for I [<b>My Shechina</b>] will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people and I may destroy you along the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,When the people heard this bad news they mourned and no man wore his ornaments [crowns].
Exodus,33,5,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Say to the B’nei Yisrael, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. Were I [<b>My Shechina</b>] to go up among you for one moment, I would destroy you. Now remove your ornaments and I know [<b>it will be revealed before Me</b>] what to do with you.’”"
Exodus,33,6,The B’nei Yisrael took off their ornaments that they had [worn] at Mount Chorev.
Exodus,33,7,"Moshe would take the tent and set it up outside the camp, a distance from the camp, and he called it [the] Tent of Meeting [<b>the house of Instruction</b>]. Everyone who sought [<b>instruction from before</b>] Adonoy, would go out to the Tent of Meeting [<b>the house of Instruction</b>] that was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"Whenever Moshe went out to the tent, all the people would rise, and each person would stand at the entrance of his tent; and they would gaze after Moshe, until he had gone into the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"When Moshe had gone into the tent, the Pillar of Cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and [Adonoy] would speak to [<b>Himself with</b>] Moshe."
Exodus,33,10,"When all the people saw the Pillar of Cloud, standing at the entrance of the tent; all the people rose and prostrated themselves, each man at the entrance of his tent."
Exodus,33,11,"Adonoy spoke to [<b>Himself with</b>] Moshe face to face [<b>word to word</b>], just as a man speaks to his friend. and [Moshe then] would return to the camp, but his youthful attendant, Yehoshua, son of Nun, did not leave the tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moshe said to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, “Behold, You say to me, ‘Lead this people up [to the land of Canaan],’ but You did not let me know whom You would send with me. You [also] said, ‘I know [<b>exalted</b>] you by name and you have also found favor in My eyes [<b>before Me</b>].’"
Exodus,33,13,"Now, please, if I have [<b>now</b>] found favor in Your eyes [<b>before You</b>], please [<b>now</b>] let me know Your [<b>the way of Your goodness</b>] way, so that I will know You [<b>Your love</b>], that I may find favor in Your eyes [<b>before You</b>]; and [also] consider [<b>it will be revealed before You</b>] that this nation is [indeed] Your people.”"
Exodus,33,14,"He [God] said, “My Presence [<b>Shechina</b>] will go [with you] and I will accede to you[r request].”"
Exodus,33,15,"And he [Moshe] said to [<b>before</b>] Him, “If Your Presence [<b>Shechina</b>] does not go [with us] do not make us leave from this [place]."
Exodus,33,16,"And how will it be known [<b>here</b>]. that I have found favor in Your eyes [<b>before You</b>]—I and Your people—only if You [<b>Your Shechina</b>] go with us, so that we will be distinguished [<b>wonders will be done for us</b>]—I and Your people—[<b>that they will be distinct</b>] from every [other] people on the face of the earth.”"
Exodus,33,17,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “I will also do this thing that you have spoken, for you have found favor in My eyes [<b>before Me</b>], and I know [<b>exalted</b>] you by name.”"
Exodus,33,18,"He [Moshe] then said, “Please [<b>Now</b>] grant me a vision of Your Glory.”"
Exodus,33,19,"He [God] said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass before your presence, and will proclaim the Name, Adonoy, in your presence. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate."
Exodus,33,20,"And He said, “You cannot see [<b>the</b>] My Presence [<b>of the Shechina</b>], for no man can see My Presence and live.”"
Exodus,33,21,"And Adonoy said, “Behold there is a place with [<b>prepared before</b>] Me, and you shall set yourself on the rock."
Exodus,33,22,"When My Glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft [<b>cave</b>] of the rock, and I will cover [<b>shelter</b>] you with My Hand [<b>Word</b>] until I pass by."
Exodus,33,23,"Then I will remove [<b>the guidance of</b>] My Hand [<b>Glory</b>], and you will see My Back [<b>that which is behind Me</b>], but My Face [<b>that which is before Me</b>] shall not be seen."
Exodus,34,1,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Carve out two stone tablets for yourself just like the first ones. And I will write upon these tablets the words which were on the first Tablets that you broke."
Exodus,34,2,"Be ready for the morning, and in the morning go up to Mount Sinai and stand there before Me on the top of the mountain."
Exodus,34,3,"No man shall go up with you, nor shall any man be seen on the entire mountain; even the sheep and cattle shall not graze before that mountain.”"
Exodus,34,4,"He [Moshe] carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones. Moshe rose early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Adonoy had commanded him; and he took the two stone tablets in his hand."
Exodus,34,5,"Adonoy descended [<b>became revealed</b>] in a cloud and it stood with him there; and he [Moshe] called out [invoked] the Name, Adonoy."
Exodus,34,6,"Adonoy [<b>made his Shechina pass</b>] passed before him, and proclaimed: “Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, merciful and gracious, slow to [<b>distancing</b>] anger, and [<b>making</b>] abounding in kindness [<b>goodness</b>] and truth [<b>abound</b>]."
Exodus,34,7,"He preserves kindness for thousands [of generations], bearing [forgiving] iniquity, transgression [<b>rebellion</b>] and sin. He clears [acquits the penitent] [<b>forgives those who return to his Torah</b>] and he does not clear [acquit the impenitent], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and [<b>rebellious</b>] children’s children, [even] upon the third and fourth [generation].”"
Exodus,34,8,"Moshe hastened, bowed to the ground, and prostrated himself,"
Exodus,34,9,"and said, “If I have found favor in Your eyes [<b>before You</b>] my Master, let [<b>the Shechina of</b>] my Master go among us; although it is a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity and our sins, and take us as Your own possession.”"
Exodus,34,10,"And He said, “I hereby make a covenant; before all your people I will perform wonders such as have not been created in all the earth or for any nation; and all the people in whose midst you are, will see how awesome is the deed of Adonoy which I will perform for you."
Exodus,34,11,"Preserve for your own sake that which I command you today. I am driving out [from] before you the Emorites, the Canaanites, the Chitites, the Perizites, the Chivities, and the Yevusites."
Exodus,34,12,"For your own sake, be careful not to make a covenant with the people who live in the land to which you are coming, lest it be a trap in your midst."
Exodus,34,13,"Rather you must shatter their altars, break down their monuments, and cut down their asherah-trees."
Exodus,34,14,"For you must not prostrate yourselves to another god [<b>false gods of the peoples</b>], because Adonoy—Jealous is His Name—He is a Jealous Almighty [God]."
Exodus,34,15,"[Take care] not to make a covenant with the people who live in the land, and go astray after their [<b>false</b>] gods [religions], and sacrifice to their [<b>false</b>] gods, [for he] will then call you and you will eat of his sacrifice."
Exodus,34,16,"You will [then] accept his daughters [as wives] for your sons. His daughters will stray after their [<b>false</b>] gods, and they will lead your sons to stray after their [<b>false</b>] gods."
Exodus,34,17,You must not make molten gods for yourselves.
Exodus,34,18,"Preserve the Festival of Matzos. Eat matzos for seven days as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of ripening [grain]; for in the month of ripening [grain] you went out of Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,"All that opens the womb [the first-born] is Mine, and of all your livestock that is male [<b>you shall sanctify</b>], that open [the womb] [<b>the first-born</b>] both cattle and sheep."
Exodus,34,20,"The [<b>first-born</b>] donkey that opens the womb shall be redeemed with a sheep, and if it is not redeemed, you must break its neck. [You must] redeem all first-born of your sons, and you must not appear before Me empty-handed."

Exodus,34,24,"For I will drive out the nations before you, and I will expand your boundaries; and no man will covet your land when you go up to appear before Adonoy, your God, three times a year."
Exodus,34,25,Do not slaughter [the Pesach-offering to offer] the blood of My sacrifice [<b>Pesach-offering</b>] while there is chometz; and do not allow to remain overnight until morning [<b>off the Altar</b>] any [<b>fats</b>] of the offering of the Pesach Festival.
Exodus,34,26,"The first fruits of your land, you shall bring to the House [<b>of the Sanctuary</b>] of Adonoy, your God. You must not cook a kid in its mother’s milk [<b>eat meat with milk</b>]."

Exodus,34,28,"He [Moshe] remained there with [<b>before</b>] Adonoy for forty days and forty nights. He did not eat bread nor drink water, and He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words [commandments.]"
Exodus,34,29,"And when Moshe came down from Mount Sinai, and the two Tablets of the Testimony were in Moshe’s hand when he came down from the Mountain. Moshe did not know that the skin [<b>splendor of the glory</b>] of his face had become radiant [<b>increased</b>] when He [God] spoke to him."
Exodus,34,30,"When Aharon and all the B’nei Yisrael saw Moshe, and beheld that the skin [<b>splendor of the glory</b>] of his face had become radiant [<b>increased</b>], they were afraid to come close to him."
Exodus,34,31,Moshe called to them and they returned to him—Aharon and all the leaders of the congregation—and Moshe spoke to them.
Exodus,34,32,"After that, all the B’nei Yisrael came close [to him] and he commanded them [regarding] all that Adonoy had spoken with him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"When Moshe finished speaking with them, he placed a [<b>face</b>] cover[<b>ing</b>] over his face."
Exodus,34,34,"[But] when Moshe came before Adonoy, to speak to Him; he removed the [<b>face</b>] cover[<b>ing</b>] until he was ready to leave. and he would then go out and speak to the B’nei Yisrael, [telling them] what he had been commanded."
Exodus,34,35,"The B’nei Yisrael saw Moshe’s face, that the skin [<b>splendor of the glory</b>] of Moshe’s face had become radiant [<b>increased</b>], and Moshe replaced the [<b>face</b>] cover[<b>ing</b>] over his face until he would come in to speak to Him [Adonoy]."
Exodus,35,1,"Moshe assembled the entire congregation of the B’nei Yisrael, and said to them, “These are the words that Adonoy has commanded you to do."
Exodus,35,2,"Work may be done six days, but the seventh day must be holy to you, it is a Shabbos of Shabbos to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. Whoever does work on it shall be put to death."

Exodus,35,21,"Every man whose heart lifted him up came—and every one whose generous spirit inspired [<b>filled</b>] him brought a terumah-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all [that was needed for] its service, and for the sacred garments."
Exodus,35,22,"And they came—both men and [<b>brought—men in addition to</b>] woman—all who were generous of heart brought bracelets, nose rings, finger rings, and buckles—all kinds of golden vessels—and every man that offered a wave-offering of gold unto [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."

Exodus,35,29,Every man and woman whose generous heart inspired them to bring something for all the work that Adonoy had commanded to be done through Moshe [did so]. The B’nei Yisrael brought a free-will gift to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Exodus,35,30,"Moshe said to the B’nei Yisrael, “See, Adonoy has designated [<b>exalted</b>] by name, Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Chur, of the tribe of Yehudah."
Exodus,35,31,"And He endowed him with Divine [<b>the</b>] spirit [<b>of prophecy from before Adonoy</b>], with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with [the skill to perform] all types of crafting."

Exodus,36,1,And they shall execute—Betzalel and Oholiov—and every wise-hearted man whom Adonoy had endowed with wisdom and insight to know (how) to execute in all of the holy work—all that Adonoy had commanded.
Exodus,36,2,"Moshe called to Betzalel and to Oholiov, and to every wise-hearted man whom Adonoy had endowed with wisdom in his heart, everyone whose heart moved him to approach the task—to execute it."
Exodus,36,3,"And they took from before Moshe, all the terumah-offering which the B’nei Yisrael brought for the tasks of the holy work, to execute it. And they continued to bring gifts each and every morning."
Exodus,36,4,All the wise men came—who were executing all the holy tasks—each and every man from the task in which he was engaged.
Exodus,36,5,They said the following to Moshe: the people are bringing too much—more than is needed for the tasks which Adonoy has commanded to execute.
Exodus,36,6,"Moshe commanded—and they proclaimed throughout the encampment saying, “Let no man or woman bring any more material for the sacred offering.” And the people stopped bringing. "
Exodus,36,7,"The material was enough for all the work that had to be done, and some was left over."
Exodus,36,8,"All craftsmen with the spirit of wisdom made the mishkon out of ten drapes, (consisting of) twined fine linen, greenish blue wool, dark red wool and crimson [<b>colored</b>] wool, figures of Cherubim, the work of a craftsman."

Leviticus,8,33,"From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go out for seven days until the time that your days of installation [<b>sacrifices</b>] are complete, because for seven days your hands [<b>sacrifices</b>] will be filled [<b>offered</b>]."
Leviticus,8,34,"Just as you have done on this day, Adonoy commanded him to do, to bring about atonement."
Leviticus,8,35,"At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit day and night for seven days and keep the charge of [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy and you will not die, because I have been thus commanded."
Leviticus,8,36,Aharon and his sons fulfilled all the edicts that Adonoy commanded through Moshe.
Leviticus,9,1,And it was on the eight day [that] Moshe called to Aharon and to his sons and to the elders of Israel.
Leviticus,9,2,"He said to Aharon, Take, for yourself, a young calf, for a sin-offering and a ram—for a burnt-offering—unblemished ones, and bring them before Adonoy."
Leviticus,9,3,"To Bnei Yisroel you shall speak, saying, take a he-goat, for a sin-offering and a calf and a lamb, both one year old—unblemished—for a burnt-offering,"
Leviticus,9,4,"an ox and a ram for a peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering, to sacrifice before Adonoy and a meal-offering mixed with oil, for today, [<b>the Glory of</b>] Adonoy will appear [<b>become revealed</b>] to you."
Leviticus,9,5,"They took that which Moshe commanded, before the Tent of Meeting; and the entire congregation approached and they stood before Adonoy."
Leviticus,9,6,Moshe said: This is what Adonoy commanded you to do: and the glory of Adonoy will appear [<b>become revealed</b>] to you.
Leviticus,9,7,"Moshe said to Aharon: Approach the altar and perform [the services of] your sin-offering and your burnt-offering and atone on your [own] behalf and on behalf of the people; and perform [the service of] the peoples offering and atone on their behalf, just as Adonoy commanded."
Leviticus,9,8,Aharon approached the altar and slaughtered the calf that he had for a sin-offering.
Leviticus,9,9,Aharons sons brought the blood to him and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it atop the corners of the altar and he poured the [remaining] blood into the base of the altar.
Leviticus,9,10,"The fat, kidneys and the lobe of the liver from the sin-offering, he burned on the altar, just as Adonoy commanded Moshe."
Leviticus,9,11,"The flesh and the skin, he burned in a fire beyond the encampment."
Leviticus,9,12,"He slaughtered the burnt-offering; and Aharons sons presented the blood to him, and he sprinkled it all around the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"They presented the burnt-offering to him with its limbs severed and [with] the head, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,"He washed the innards and the feet and burned them on the burnt-offering, on the altar."
Leviticus,9,15,"He brought the peoples offering; he took the peoples sin-offering-goat, and he slaughtered it and offered it as a sin-offering [<b>atoned with its blood</b>], in the same manner as the first one."
Leviticus,9,16,He brought the burnt-offering and he did it according to the rule.
Leviticus,9,17,He brought the meal-offering; he filled his palm from it and burned it on the altar: aside from the burnt-offering [that was brought] in the morning.
Leviticus,9,18,"He slaughtered the ox and the ram, the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings of the people; and Aharons sons presented the blood to him and he sprinkled it all around the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"The fats of the ox and of the ram; the fat-tail, the [fat] covering [the innards], the kidneys and the lobe of the liver."
Leviticus,9,20,They put the fats on top of the breasts and he burned the fats on the altar.
Leviticus,9,21,"The breasts and the right thigh, Aharon waved [<b>lifted up</b>] [as] a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy, just as Moshe commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Aharon raised his hands toward the people and he blessed them. He descended [from the altar where he] had offered the sin-offering, the burnt-offering and the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering."
Leviticus,9,23,"And Moshe and Aharon went [in]to the Tent of Meeting and [then] they went outside and blessed the people, and the glory of Adonoy appeared [<b>became revealed</b>] to the entire people."
Leviticus,9,24,"A fire came forth from before Adonoy and consumed what was on the altar; the burnt-offering and the fats. All the people saw and they raised their voices in praise, and they fell on their faces."
Leviticus,10,1,"Nodov and Avihu, Aharons sons, took, each of them his fire-pan, placed fire on it and then placed incense upon it and they brought before Adonoy a strange fire, which He had not commanded them."
Leviticus,10,2,"A fire came forth from before Adonoy and consumed them, and they died in the presence of Adonoy."
Leviticus,10,3,"Moshe said to Aharon It is as Adonoy spoke, saying: through those that are near me I shall be sanctified, and in the presence of the entire people I will be glorified, and Aharon was silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moshe called to Mishael and to Elzafan the sons of Uziel, [<b>the brother of the father of</b>] Aharon’s uncle, and said to them; Come closer and carry your brothers from the presence of the Sanctuary, to beyond the encampment."
Leviticus,10,5,"They came closer and they carried them in their tunics to beyond the encampment, just as Moshe spoke."
Leviticus,10,6,"Moshe said to Aharon and to Elozor and Isomor, his sons: Do not let your hair grow long and do not tear your garments so that you will not die and bring [Divine] anger on the entire congregation; your brothers, the entire House of Yisroel shall weep over the conflagration that Adonoy set ablaze."
Leviticus,10,7,From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go forth lest you die; for the anointing oil of [<b>the inauguration to greatness of</b>] Adonoy is on you and they did as Moshe had said.
Leviticus,10,8,"Adonoy spoke to Aharon, saying,"
Leviticus,10,9,"Do not drink wine or any other intoxicant, you and your sons with you, when you enter the Tent of Meeting and you will not die; this is an everlasting statute throughout your generations."
Leviticus,10,10,"[So that you may] distinguish between what is sacred and what is mundane, between what is impure and what is pure."
Leviticus,10,11,"[And that you may] teach Bnei Yisroel all the statutes that Adonoy spoke to them, through Moshe."
Leviticus,10,12,"Moshe spoke to Aharon and to Elozor and Isomor, his surviving sons; Take the meal-offering which remains of the fire-offering [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy and eat it [as] <i>matzos</i> [<b>matzoh</b>] [unleavened] beside the altar, for it is holy of holies [=most holy]."
Leviticus,10,13,"You shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is your portion and the portion of your sons of the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy, for so have I been commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,"The breast of the wave-offering [<b>uplifted-offering</b>] and the thigh that is the separated portion you shall eat in a pure (undefiled) place, you and your sons and daughters with you, for as your portion and as the portion of your sons they are given from the sacrifices of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings of Bnei Yisroel."
Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh that is the separated portion and the breast that is the wave-offering [<b>uplifted-offering</b>], on top of the fats of the fire offering [<b>offering</b>], they shall bring, to wave [<b>lift up</b>] as a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy. It will be for you and for your sons with you an everlasting statute, just as Adonoy commanded."
Leviticus,10,16,"Regarding the goat of the sin-offering; Moshe made a detailed inquiry and behold! It was burned. He was angry with Elozor and Isomor, the remaining sons of Aharon, saying:"
Leviticus,10,17,"Why did you not eat the sin-offering in a sacred place, for it is holy of holies [=most holy], and He gave it to you, to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to atone for them before Adonoy."
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold its blood was not brought inside the Sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in a holy place as I have commanded."
Leviticus,10,19,"Aharon spoke [in reply] to Moshe, Behold, today they brought their sin-offerings and their burnt-offerings before Adonoy and then such [tragedy] befell me. If I had eaten the sin-offering today, would that have been good in the eyes of [<b>fitting before</b>] Adonoy?"
Leviticus,10,20,"Moshe heard, and it was good [<b>pleasing</b>] in his eyes."
Leviticus,11,1,"And Adonoy spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying to them:"
Leviticus,11,2,"Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying: these are the living things that you may eat from among all the animals that are on the earth."

Leviticus,23,28,"You shall not do any work on this very day, for it is a day of atonements, to atone for you before Adonoy, your God."

Leviticus,23,33,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Leviticus,23,34,"Speak to Bnei Yisroel saying; on the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the festival of [<b>shelters</b>] Sukkos for seven days, for [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."

It is [a day] of convocation. you shall not do any work of labor."
Leviticus,23,37,"These are the appointed times of Adonoy which you shall proclaim [<b>cause</b>] them [<b>to occur</b>] [as] holy assemblies [<b>occurrences</b>], on which to bring a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy; a burnt-offering and a meal-offering, a [<b>sacred-</b>]sacrifice and wine-offerings, each on its assigned day,"
Leviticus,23,38,Besides the [offerings of the] <i>Shabbasos</i> of Adonoy and besides your gifts and besides all your vow-offerings and besides all your free-will-offerings that you will give to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Leviticus,23,39,"Indeed, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather the produce of the land you shall celebrate the festival of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy for seven days. The first day is a day of rest and the eighth day is a day of rest."
Leviticus,23,40,"You shall take for yourselves, on the first day, the fruit of the beautiful tree (<i>esrog</i>) [<b>esrogim</b>], a branch of palm trees (<i>lulav</i>) [<b>lulavim</b>], boughs of thick-leaved trees (<i>hadasim</i>), and willows of the brook (<i>aravos</i>), and you shall rejoice before Adonoy, your God, for seven days."

Leviticus,23,42,"You shall dwell in the [<b>shelters</b>] <i>sukkos</i> seven days, every native born [<b>settled</b>] Israelite shall dwell in the [<b>shelters</b>] <i>sukkos</i>."
Leviticus,23,43,"So that your generations will know that in the [<b>clouds of shelter</b>] <i>sukkos</i> I caused Bnei Yisroel to dwell when I took them out from the land of Egypt, I am Adonoy, your God."
Leviticus,23,44,And thus Moshe declared the [<b>order of the</b>] appointed times of Adonoy [<b>and taught them</b>] to Bnei Yisroel.
Leviticus,24,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Leviticus,24,2,"Command Bnei Yisroel to take (bring) to you pure, pressed, olive oil for illumination to keep the lamp [<b>lamps</b>] burning constantly."

Leviticus,24,8,"On each and every <i>Shabbos</i> he shall arrange them before Adonoy, continually, from [<b>before</b>] Bnei Yisroel as an eternal covenant."
Leviticus,24,9,"It shall belong to Aharon and to his sons and they shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is most holy for him from among the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy, as an everlasting statute."
Leviticus,24,10,"The son of an Israelite woman went out, and he was the son of an Egyptian man, among Bnei Yisroel. They argued in the encampment—the son of the Israelite woman, and the Israelite man."
Leviticus,24,11,"The Israelite womans son clearly pronounced the Name [of God] and blasphemed [<b>caused anger</b>] and they brought him to Moshe. The name of his mother was Shlomis, daughter of Divri of the tribe of Dan."
Leviticus,24,12,They placed [<b>bound</b>] him in the guardhouse until [his penalty] would be explained to them through the [<b>law of the</b>] word of Adonoy.
Leviticus,24,13,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Leviticus,24,14,"Take the blasphemer [<b>one who has caused anger</b>] beyond the encampment, and all those who heard him shall lay their hands on his head and the entire congregation shall stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"And to Bnei Yisroel you shall speak, saying; Any person who shall blaspheme [<b>cause anger before</b>] his God shall bear [the burden of] his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"Whoever pronounces clearly the Name of Adonoy [and blasphemes] he will surely be put to death. The entire congregation shall surely stone him. The proselyte and native born [<b>settled one</b>] alike when he clearly articulates the Name, shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,Any man who kills any human being must surely be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,"Whoever kills an animal shall pay for it, [the compensation of] an animal for an animal."
Leviticus,24,19,"A man who maims his neighbor just as he did, so shall be done to him."
Leviticus,24,20,"[Compensation for] a broken bone [in exchange] for a broken bone, [compen-sation for] the loss of an eye [in exchange] for the loss of an eye, [compensation for] the loss to a tooth [in exchange] for the loss of a tooth; just as he maimed the man, so shall it be done to him [monetarily]."
Leviticus,24,21,Whoever smites [<b>kills</b>] an animal shall pay for it. Whoever smites [<b>kills</b>] a person shall be put to death.
Leviticus,24,22,"One rule shall apply for all of you just as it is for the proselyte, so it shall be for the native born [<b>settled one</b>], for I am Adonoy, your God."
Leviticus,24,23,"Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisroel and they took the blasphemer [<b>one who caused anger</b>], beyond the encampment and they stoned him with a stone. And Bnei Yisroel did just as Adonoy commanded Moshe."
Leviticus,25,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe on Mount Sinai, saying;"
Leviticus,25,2,"Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them, when you come to the land which I give to you the land shall be at rest—a <i>Shabbos</i> for [<b>rest before</b>] Adonoy."
Leviticus,25,3,For six years you shall plant your field and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and you shall harvest its produce.
Leviticus,25,4,"But the seventh year shall be a <i>Shabbos</i> of [<b>complete</b>] rest for the land, a <i>Shabbos</i> for [<b>rest before</b>] Adonoy, you shall not plant your field and you shall not prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"[Even] crops that grew on their own [from the seeds of your previous] harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your untended vines you shall not gather; it shall be a year of complete rest for the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"The [produce] [<b>rest</b>] of the lands <i>Shabbos</i>[-year] [<b>land</b>] shall be for yourselves, for food, for you, your servant and your maidservant, for your hired hand and your resident sojourner who reside with you."
Leviticus,25,7,[Also] for your domesticated animals and for the [wild] beasts that are in your land shall all of its produce be for food.
Leviticus,25,8,"You shall count for yourself seven sabbatical years [<b>of rest</b>], seven years, seven times and it shall be for you, the days (period) of the seven sabbatical years [<b>of rest</b>], forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,You shall make a proclamation [<b>crying</b>] with the <i>shofor</i> on the tenth day of the seventh month. On Yom Kippur shall this <i>shofor</i>-proclamation be made. throughout all your land.
Leviticus,25,10,You shall sanctify the year of the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all of its inhabitants; it shall be for you a jubilee and each man shall return to his ancestral land and each man shall return to his family.
Leviticus,25,11,"It is a jubilee, [that] the year of the fiftieth year shall be for you. You shall not plant and you shall not reap [even] crops that grew on their own; and you shall not gather the [grapes of] its untended vineyard,"
Leviticus,25,12,"For it is a jubilee, it shall be holy to you. Whatever is in the field, you may eat of its produce."
Leviticus,25,13,"On this jubilee year, each man shall return to his ancestral land."
Leviticus,25,14,"If you sell anything to your neighbor, or purchase [something] from your neighbor, do not cheat one another."
Leviticus,25,15,According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall purchase [land] from your neighbor; according to the number of produce years he shall sell it to you.
Leviticus,25,16,"Based on the abundance of years, you shall increase its purchase price and based on the lack of years you shall decrease its purchase price, since it is the number of produce-seasons that he is selling to you."
Leviticus,25,17,"You shall not cheat one another, and you shall fear your God for I am Adonoy, your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"You shall fulfill My statutes and keep My laws and fulfill them, and you will then live in the land in security."
Leviticus,25,19,"The land will give forth its fruit and you will eat your fill, and you will live securely on it."
Leviticus,25,20,"If you shall say (ask) What will we eat in the seventh year, for lo! we have not planted nor gathered our produce?"
Leviticus,25,21,I shall command (direct) My blessing to you in the sixth year and it will produce [enough] for three years.
Leviticus,25,22,You shall plant in the eighth year but you will still be eating from the old produce until the ninth year; until the [new] produce arrives (ripens) you shall eat [from] the old.
Leviticus,25,23,"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is Mine, for, you are [merely as] foreigners [<b>foreign resident</b>] and resident aliens [<b>residents</b>] before Me."
Leviticus,25,24,In all of your ancestral lands you shall grant redemption to the land.
Leviticus,25,25,"If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his ancestral land, and a close relative comes and redeems that which his brother sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"[Or] if the man has no redeemer (close relative) but has acquired sufficient means and finds [it] enough to redeem it [himself],"
Leviticus,25,27,"He shall calculate the number of years for which he sold the land and return the remainder (excess) to the man to whom he had sold it, and he shall return to his ancestral land."
Leviticus,25,28,"Or if he does not have within his means enough to retrieve the land to himself, then that which he sold remains in the possession of the buyer until the jubilee year. It is then released by the jubilee and he [the seller] returns to his ancestral land."
Leviticus,25,29,"If a man shall sell a residential home [that is] within [<b>surrounded by</b>] a walled city, the time allotted for its redemption shall be until the end of one year after he sold it. He has the days [of a full year] in which to redeem it."
Leviticus,25,30,"If he does not redeem it by the end of a full year, the house within the city that is surrounded by a wall shall then remain in perpetuity to its purchaser for his generations (descendants.) It is not released by the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,The houses of open cities which are not surrounded by a [<b>an encircling</b>] wall shall be considered as a field of the land. It shall have a redemption and it is released by the jubilee.
Leviticus,25,32,"The cities of the Levites the houses in the cities of their ancestral land, the Levites shall have an eternal right of redemption."
Leviticus,25,33,"If anyone redeems [a house or field] from the Levites, then the house or his ancestral city shall be released by the jubilee, for the houses of the Levitic cities are [considered] their ancestral lands among Bnei Yisroel."
Leviticus,25,34,The field on the outskirts of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual ancestral land.
Leviticus,25,35,"If your brother becomes impoverished and his hand (assets) become shaky among you, you must support him, [so too] the proselyte [<b>foreign resident</b>] and the sojourner, [so] that he shall live with you."
Leviticus,25,36,"You shall not take from him interest or usury and you shall fear your God, and your brother shall live with you."
Leviticus,25,37,"You must not give (lend) him your money with interest, and usuriously you must not advance him your food."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am Adonoy your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to be a God for you."
Leviticus,25,39,"If your brother becomes impoverished and is sold to you, you must not work him like a slave [<b>slaves</b>]."
Leviticus,25,40,Like a hired hand or resident [worker] shall he be with you He shall serve you until the jubilee year.
Leviticus,25,41,Then he and his children shall depart from you and return to his own family. He shall return to his ancestral estate.
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are My servants, whom I brought out from the land of Egypt, they shall not be sold [in the market] as slaves."
Leviticus,25,43,You must not rule over him [<b>make him work</b>] to crush him and you shall fear your God.
Leviticus,25,44,"Your slaves and maidservants that you shall possess from the nations that surround you, from them you may purchase slaves and maidservants."
Leviticus,25,45,"Also, from the children of the [<b>uncircumcised</b>] sojourners who reside with you from them you may purchase [slaves], and from their families that live among you that were born in your land. [All these] shall be your permanent possession."
Leviticus,25,46,"You shall will them as inheritance to your children after you as hereditary property; you shall keep them in servitude permanently. However regarding your bretheren, Bnei Yisroel, man over his brother, you must not rule over him [<b>make him work</b>] to crush him."
Leviticus,25,47,"If a foreigner [<b>an uncircumcised one</b>] or resident acquires means while your brother becomes impoverished by him, and is sold to a [<b>an uncircumcised</b>] resident foreigner who resides with you or to the offspring [<b>a non-Jew</b>] of a foreign [<b>proselyte</b>] family."
Leviticus,25,48,"After he is sold redemption shall be his, one of his bretheren shall redeem him."
Leviticus,25,49,Either his uncle [<b>father’s brother</b>] or his uncles son [<b>the son of his father’s brother</b>] (cousin) shall redeem him or the closest (other) family relative shall redeem him. If he obtains sufficient means of his own he may be redeemed [on his own.]
Leviticus,25,50,He shall reckon with the one who bought him. [According to the number of years] from the year which he was sold to him until the jubilee year. His purchase price shall be [proportional] to the number of years; at the rate of the days of a hired hand it shall be [considered as he worked] with him.
Leviticus,25,51,If there are yet many years [until the jubilee] accordingly shall he return his redemption money from his purchase price.
Leviticus,25,52,"If there remain but a few years until the jubilee year, he shall make a [similar] calculation, based on the number of years he shall return his redemption money [to the purchaser.]"
Leviticus,25,53,As a hired hand [working] on a yearly basis shall he be considered with him; he shall not rule over him [<b>make him work</b>] to crush him before your eyes.
Leviticus,25,54,"If he is not redeemed through these means he then goes out in the jubilee year, he, along with his children."
Leviticus,25,55,"For, Bnei Yisroel are My servants. They are My servants whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt, I am Adonoy, your God."
Leviticus,26,1,"You shall not make [<b>false</b>] idols for yourselves and graven images and memorial stones you shall not raise up for youselves, and a prostration stone you shall not set in your land upon which to prostrate oneself, for I am Adonoy, your God."
Leviticus,26,2,"You shall keep [<b>the days of</b>] My Shabbosos and you shall fear (revere) [<b>the House of</b>] My Sanctuary, I am Adonoy."
Leviticus,26,3,"If you follow My statutes and keep My commandments and you will fulfill them,"
Leviticus,26,4,I will provide your rains in their proper time. The earth shall give forth its produce and the tree of the field shall give forth its produce.
Leviticus,26,5,"[Because of the abundant produce] threshing will overtake the grape harvest and the grape harvest overtake the [time to] plant, and you will eat your bread to satiation and you will live securely in your land."
Leviticus,26,6,"I will grant peace in the land; you will lie down (sleep) [<b>rest</b>] without disturbance (fear). I will banish [<b>nullify</b>] evil beasts from the land, and no [<b>people who kill with a</b>] sword shall pass through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,You will pursue your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you will pursue one hundred and one hundred of you will pursue ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"I will turn [<b>with My Word to do good</b>] to you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and establish My covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,You will eat the old [store] long kept and the old [store] you will have to clear out because of the new.
Leviticus,26,11,I will set My Sanctuary among you and My spirit [<b>Word</b>] will not loathe (reject) you.
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk [<b>rest My Shechina</b>] among you and I will be a God for you, and you will be My [<b>before Me for a</b>] people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am Adonoy your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt from where you were slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke [<b>of the peoples from you</b>] and led you forth standing upright [<b>to freedom</b>]."
Leviticus,26,14,And if you will not listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>] and you will not fulfill all of these commandments.
Leviticus,26,15,"If you despise My statutes and your souls loathe [<b>reject</b>] My laws so as not to fulfill all My commandments, thereby breaking [<b>changing</b>] My convenant."
Leviticus,26,16,"Then I will do the same with you. I will impose terror upon you, [which causes] swelling and fever that consume [<b>darken</b>] the eyes and fill the soul with grief. You will plant [your seeds] in vain because your enemies will consume [your crops.]"
Leviticus,26,17,I will set my face [<b>anger</b>] against you and you will be defeated [<b>smitten</b>] before your enemies; your foes will rule over you and you will flee [even] when no one is pursuing you.
Leviticus,26,18,"If after these [catastrophes] you still do not listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>], then I will increase your punishment sevenfold, as your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,I will break the pride [<b>glory</b>] of your power. I will make your [<b>the</b>] heavens [<b>which are above you</b>] like [<b>as strong as</b>] iron [<b>to bring no rain down</b>] and your [<b>the</b>] land [<b>which is beneath you</b>] like [<b>as powerful as</b>] copper [<b>producing no fruit</b>].
Leviticus,26,20,Your strength will be exhausted in vain. Your land will not yield its produce and the tree[s] of the land will not give forth its produce.
Leviticus,26,21,"If you walk contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me and have no desire to listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>], I will increase [<b>to bring</b>] the blows upon you sevenfold, as your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will send [<b>incite</b>] among you wild animals of the field and they will make you bereft of children, destroy your cattle, reduce your [population] and make your roads into wasteland."
Leviticus,26,23,"If after these [catastrophes] you have not been disciplined [to listen] to Me [<b>My Word</b>], and walk contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me,"
Leviticus,26,24,"[Then] I, too, will walk contrary to you; and I shall also smite you seven fold, for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,I will bring [<b>people who kill with a sword</b>] an avenging sword upon you avenging the covenant [<b>and they will avenge from you a vengeance for transgressing the words of the Torah</b>] You will be huddled [in your cities]. I will send [<b>incite</b>] pestilence among you and you will be given into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus,26,26,"When I break the staff of your bread [<b>food</b>], ten women will bake your bread in one oven and they will return your bread by weight. You will eat but you will not be satiated."
Leviticus,26,27,"If [in spite] of this you [still] will not listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>], and you will walk contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me,"
Leviticus,26,28,"I will walk contrary to you in fury, and indeed I too shall punish you sevenfold, for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,You will eat the flesh of your sons and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
Leviticus,26,30,"I will destroy your high places and I will smash your sun images. I will set your corpses upon the carcasses (remains) of your [<b>false</b>] idols, and My soul [<b>word</b>] will loathe [<b>reject</b>] you."
Leviticus,26,31,I will turn your cities into ruins and bring your Sanctuaries into desolation. I will no longer scent (accept favorably) the fragrance of your offerings [<b>the offering of your gatherings</b>].
Leviticus,26,32,I will make the land [so] desolate that your enemies who live on it will be astonished.
Leviticus,26,33,I will scatter you among the nations and unsheath [<b>incite people who kill with</b>] the sword after you. Your land will be desolate and your cities will be in ruins.
Leviticus,26,34,The land will then be appeased for its Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>] [during] all the days of its desolation while you are in the land of your enemies. Then the land will rest and be appeased for its Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>].
Leviticus,26,35,All the days that it lies desolate it shall have its rest—the rest it did not have on your Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>] when you were living upon it.
Leviticus,26,36,"To those who survive among you, I will send timidity [<b>brokenness</b>] into their hearts [as they live] in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a blown leaf [<b>beating</b>] will put them to flight and they will flee as though fleeing from [<b>before people who kill with</b>] a sword; and they will fall with no one chasing them."
Leviticus,26,37,"They will stumble over one other as though before [<b>people who kill with</b>] a sword when there is no pursuer, and you will have no power to stand upright before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,You will be lost among the nations and the land of your enemies will consume you.
Leviticus,26,39,"Those of you who survive will rot away [<b>melt</b>] in their iniquity in the land of your enemies, and also due to the iniquities of their [<b>evil</b>] ancestors which are [still] with them [<b>they hold in their hands</b>], [they] will they rot away [<b>melt</b>]."
Leviticus,26,40,"They will [then] confess their iniquities and the iniquities of their ancestors in the unfaithfulness [<b>dishonesty</b>] with which they were unfaithful [<b>dishonest</b>] to [<b>before</b>] Me, and also for walking contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me."
Leviticus,26,41,"I, too, will go contrary to them and bring them into the land of their enemies. Or perhaps then will be humbled [<b>broken</b>] their uncircumcised (unyielding) [<b>unwise</b>] heart and then their iniquities will be appeased (forgiven)."
Leviticus,26,42,"I will [then] remember My covenant with Yaakov and also My covenant with Yitzchok and also My covenant with Avrohom, I will remember and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"The land, being bereft of them, will be appeased for its Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>], during the time of its desolation from them and their iniquities will then be appeased (forgiven) [<b>I will bring upon them curses instead of blessings</b>] since what certainly caused [this] is that they despised My laws and their soul loathed (rejected) My statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"All this not withstanding, even when they are in the land of their enemies I will not despise [<b>abandon</b>] them and I will not loathe [<b>reject</b>] them to annihilate them, to break [<b>change</b>] My covenant with them, for I am Adonoy, their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"I shall remember for them the covenant of their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in sight of the nations to be a God for them, I am Adonoy."
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the statutes, the laws and the teachings that Adonoy set between Himself [<b>His Word</b>] and between Bnei Yisroel, on Mount Sinai, through the hand of Moshe."
Leviticus,27,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Leviticus,27,2,"Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them; when a person [orally] expresses a vow pledging valuation of souls, to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."
Leviticus,27,3,"The valuation for a male shall be, from twenty years of age to sixty years of age your valuation shall be fifty holy silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>]."
Leviticus,27,4,"If it be a female, the valuation shall be thirty <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>]."
Leviticus,27,5,"If from five years of age to twenty years of age the valuation for a male shall be twenty <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>], and for a female, ten <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>]."
Leviticus,27,6,If from one month of age to five years of age the valuation of a male shall be five silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>] and the valuation for a female is three silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
Leviticus,27,7,"If from sixty and above, if he is a male the valuation shall be fifteen <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>] and for a female, ten <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>]."
Leviticus,27,8,"If he is [too] poor to pay the valuation he shall set him[self] [=he shall be presented] before the <i>kohein,</i> and the <i>kohein</i> will determine his valuation. According to the means of the one who vowed the <i>kohein</i> will determine his valuation."
Leviticus,27,9,"If [it is] an animal which can be brought as an offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, any of it that he will give to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy shall become sacred."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not exchange it [with anothers animal] and he shall not change it [with his own animal] whether it be a good one for a worse one [or] a bad one for a better one. If he did exchange one animal for another animal, then both it and its replacement shall be sacred."
Leviticus,27,11,"If it is any unclean (blemished) animal which cannot be offered to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, he shall present the animal to the <i>kohein.</i>"
Leviticus,27,12,"The <i>kohein</i> shall determine its value whether it is good or bad as the <i>kohein</i> determines its value for you, so shall it be."
Leviticus,27,13,If he will indeed redeem it he shall add on one fifth to its valuation.

Numbers,9,6,"There were men who were impure, having had [contact with] a corpse, and they were not able to perform the Pesach-offering on that day, and they drew near before Moshe and before Aharon, on that day."
Numbers,9,7,"Those men said to him: “We are impure, having had contact with a corpse; why should we be excluded and not be able to bring the offering of Adonoy in its proper time, among Bnei Yisroel?”"
Numbers,9,8,Moshe said to them: “Stand [<b>wait</b>] and I will listen to what Adonoy will instruct [<b>command</b>] for [<b>regarding</b>] you.”
Numbers,9,9,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,9,10,"Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying; any person, if he will be impure from a corpse, or [is] on a distant road, [whether among] yourselves or for your descendants, he shall perform the Pesach-offering for Adonoy"
Numbers,9,11,"in the second month, on the fourteenth day in the afternoon he shall perform it. Together with <i>matzohs</i> and bitter herbs they shall eat it."
Numbers,9,12,They shall not leave any of it over until the morning and they shall not break any of its bones; according to all the statutes of the Pesach-offering they shall perform it.
Numbers,9,13,"The person who is pure and was not on the road, and refrained from performing the Pesach-offering, that soul shall be cut off from its people, for the offering of Adonoy he did not bring in its proper time; that person shall bear his sin."
Numbers,9,14,If a proselyte dwells among you and brings the Pesach-offering to Adonoy; according to the statues of the Pesach-offering and according to its laws so shall he perform it; there shall be the same statute for yourselves; [both] for the proselyte and for the native born citizen.
Numbers,9,15,"On the day that the <i>Mishkon</i> was erected, the Cloud covered the <i>Mishkon</i> [which served] as the Tent of Testimony; and in the evening, there was over the <i>Mishkon</i> an appearance of fire, until morning."
Numbers,9,16,"So it always was, the Cloud covered it, and an appearance of fire, at night."
Numbers,9,17,"Whenever the Cloud was lifted from the Tent, afterwards, did Bnei Yisroel travel; in the place where the Cloud came to rest, it is there that Bnei Yisroel did camp."
Numbers,9,18,"On the word of Adonoy, did Bnei Yisroel travel and on the word of Adonoy, did they camp; all those days on which the Cloud will rested above the <i>Mishkon</i>, did they camp."
Numbers,9,19,"When the Cloud tarried above the <i>Mishkon</i>, for many days, Bnei Yisroel would keep the watch of [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy and they would not travel."
Numbers,9,20,It sometimes happened that the Cloud was for a number of days above the <i>Mishkon</i>; on the order of Adonoy did they camp and on the order of Adonoy did they travel.
Numbers,9,21,"It sometimes happened that the Cloud was [there] [but] from evening until morning, and then the Cloud rose in the morning and they traveled; or, [the Cloud was there] for a day and a night and the Cloud was lifted, and they traveled."
Numbers,9,22,Or two days or a month or a year [<b>period of time</b>] that the Cloud prolonged its stay above the <i>Mishkon</i> to rest upon it; Bnei Yisroel remained encamped and they did not travel; when it rose they traveled.
Numbers,9,23,"On the order of Adonoy they camped and on the order of [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy they traveled; they kept the watch of Adonoy on the order of Adonoy, through Moshe."
Numbers,10,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,10,2,"Make for yourself two silver trumpets; you shall make them, beaten [from one block], and they shall be used by you to summon the congregation and to initiate the departure of the camps."
Numbers,10,3,"When they will blow them, the entire congregation shall present itself to you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"But if they blow one of them, the leaders shall present themselves to you, the heads of Israel’s thousands."
Numbers,10,5,When you blow a <i>teruah</i> [<b>a wailing sound</b>]; the camps that are camped eastward shall travel.
Numbers,10,6,"If you blow a second <i>teruah,</i> then shall travel the camps that are camped on the south side. They shall blow a <i>teruah</i> for their journeys."
Numbers,10,7,"But when gathering the congregation, you shall blow [a blast], but not a <i>teruah.</i>"
Numbers,10,8,"The sons of Aharon, the <i>kohanim,</i> shall sound the trumpets. This shall be for you an everlasting statute, for all your descendants."
Numbers,10,9,"If war shall come into your land against the oppresor who oppresses you and you shall blow <i>teruahs</i> [<b>wail</b>] with the trumpets and you will be remembered [<b>your remembrance will come beneficially</b>] before Adonoy, your God, and you will be delivered from you enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"On your joyous days and on your festivals and on the beginnings of your months you shall blow with the trumpets for your burnt-offerings and for your peace-offerings; and it shall be a remembrance for you before your God, I am Adonoy your God."
Numbers,10,11,"It was in the second year, in the second month on the twentieth of the month that the Cloud rose up from above the <i>Mishkon</i> of the Testimony."
Numbers,10,12,"Bnei Yisroel traveled along on their journeys, from the Sinai desert, and the Cloud came to rest in the desert of Paran."
Numbers,10,13,"This was the first time that they traveled, on the order of Adonoy, through Moshe."
Numbers,10,14,Then traveled the banner of the sons of Yehudah’s camp in the forefront according to their divisions; in charge of its divisions [was] Nachshon the son of Aminadav.
Numbers,10,15,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Yissachar, [was] Nesanel the son of Tzu’ar."
Numbers,10,16,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Zevulun, [was] Eliav the son of Cheilon."
Numbers,10,17,"[Then] the <i>Mishkon</i> was dismantled and the sons of Gershon traveled, with the sons of Merori, those who carried the <i>Mishkon</i>."
Numbers,10,18,"[Then] the banner of Reuven’s camp traveled, according to their divisions. In charge of its division [was] Elitzur the son of Shdeiur."
Numbers,10,19,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Shimon, [was] Shlumiel the son of Tzurishadai."
Numbers,10,20,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Gad, [was] Elyasaf the son of De’uel."
Numbers,10,21,"[Then] the Kehos family traveled, the carriers of the sacred, and they erected the <i>Mishkon</i> by the time of their arrival."
Numbers,10,22,"[Then] the banner of the sons of Ephraim’s camp traveled according to their divisions. In charge of its division, [was] Elishamah the son of Amihud."
Numbers,10,23,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Menashe, [was] Gamliel the son of Pedahtzur."
Numbers,10,24,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Binyamin, [was] Avidan the son of Gid’oni."
Numbers,10,25,"[Then] the banner of the sons of Don’s camp traveled; the gatherer for all the camps, according to their divisions. In charge of its division, [was] Achiezer the son of Amishadai."
Numbers,10,26,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Asher, [was] Pagiel the son of Ochran."
Numbers,10,27,"In charge of the division of the tribe of the sons of Naftali, [was] Achirah the son of Einan."
Numbers,10,28,These are the journeys of Bnei Yisroel according to their divisions; and they journeyed.
Numbers,10,29,"Moshe said to Chovav the son of Reuel, the Midianite, Moshe’s father-in-law: “We are journeying to the place about which Adonoy said; ‘I will give it to you’, come along with us and we will treat you well, for Adonoy spoke of bringing good [fortune] on Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"He said to him “I will not go, but rather to my land and to my birthplace will I go.”"
Numbers,10,31,"He said to him “please do not forsake us, for, because you know of our encampment in the desert, and you will be our eyes [<b>the great things that were done for us you saw with your eyes</b>]."
Numbers,10,32,"It will be, that when you go with us, it shall be that the very good which Adonoy will bestow on us we will bestow on (share with) you."
Numbers,10,33,"They traveled from the mountain of Adonoy [<b>upon which the glory of Hashem was revealed</b>] a journey of three days, and the Ark of the Covenant of Adonoy traveled in front of them a journey of three days, to prepare for them a place to settle."
Numbers,10,34,The Cloud [<b>of the glory</b>] of Adonoy was above them by day when they traveled from the camp.
Numbers,10,35,"Whenever the Ark departed Moshe woud say: “Rise, [<b>reveal Yourself</b>] Adonoy, and may Your enemies disperse, and those who hate You flee before You.”"
Numbers,10,36,"When it rested, he would say: “Come to rest, Adonoy, [<b>dwell in Your glory</b>] among the myriads and thousands of Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,The people were like complainers; [it was] wicked in the ears of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. Adonoy heard [<b>before Hashem it was revealed</b>] and His Anger flared and the fire of [<b>from before</b>] Adonoy burned among them and consumed [some] of the outcasts of the camp.
Numbers,11,2,"The people cried out to Moshe, and Moshe prayed to Adonoy, and the fire subsided."
Numbers,11,3,"He called the name of that place Taveirah, for it was there that burned among them the fire of [<b>from before</b>] Adonoy."
Numbers,11,4,"The collection [of nationalities] among them began to have strong cravings [<b>make demands</b>], and Bnei Yisroel turned and began to weep; and they said “Who will feed us meat?"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, watermelons, leeks, onions and garlic."
Numbers,11,6,"Now our bodies are withered, there is nothing at all, but the manna before our eyes.”"
Numbers,11,7,The manna was like coriander seed and it is similiar to the appearance of crystal.
Numbers,11,8,"The people [merely] strolled about and they gathered it and [<b>if they so desired,</b>] they ground it with a millstone or [<b>if they so desired,</b>] crushed it in mortars and cooked it in pots and made cakes out of it. Its taste was like the taste of cake kneaded with oil."
Numbers,11,9,"When the dew would descend on the camp, at night, the manna would descend on it."
Numbers,11,10,"Moshe heard the people weep according to their families, at the door of each one’s tent. The Anger of Adonoy was greatly aroused and in Moshe’s eyes, it was evil."
Numbers,11,11,"Moshe said to Adonoy: “Why have you dealt poorly with Your servant, and why have I not found favor in Your eyes that You place the burden of the entire people upon me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Have I conceived [<b>am I a father to</b>] this entire people? have I given birth to it [<b>are they my children</b>] that You say to me, carry it [<b>with might</b>] in your lap as a nurse carries an infant, to the land which You swore to their forefathers?"
Numbers,11,13,"From where do I have meat to give to this entire people on account of which they cry to me, saying: “Give us meat and we shall eat.”"
Numbers,11,14,"I alone can not carry this entire people, for they are too burdensome for me."
Numbers,11,15,"If this is the way You treat me, please kill me, if I have found favor in Your eyes [<b>before You</b>]; so that I will not see my evil.”"
Numbers,11,16,"Adonoy said to Moshe: “Gather seventy men for [<b>before</b>] Me, from among the elders of Israel, [men] whom you know to be the people’s elders, and its officers, and you shall take them to the Tent of Meeting, and they shall stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"I will descend [<b>appear</b>] and speak there with you, and I will make greater the spirit which is upon you, and place it on them, and they will bear, along with you, the burden of the people so that you need not bear it alone."
Numbers,11,18,"You shall say to the people, prepare yourselves for the morrow and you shall eat meat, for you have cried in the ears of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, saying: “Who will feed us meat; we had it good in Egypt;” [now] Adonoy gives you meat and you shall eat."
Numbers,11,19,"Not for one day will you be eating and not for two days; not for five days, not for ten days, and not for twenty days."
Numbers,11,20,"But rather for a month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils [<b>will disgust you</b>] and it will be repulsive to you; [this is] because you have rejected [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy Who[<b>’s Shechinah dwells</b>] is among you, and you have cried before Him, saying: “Why have we come out from Egypt?”"
Numbers,11,21,"Moshe said: “The people are six hundred thousand on foot that I am among and You say that I will give them meat, to eat it for a month of days?"
Numbers,11,22,"Will sheep and cattle be slaughtered for them would that be sufficient for them? If all the fish of the sea would be gathered for them, would that be sufficient for them?”"
Numbers,11,23,Adonoy said to Moshe: “Has [<b>can</b>] the Hand [<b>word</b>] of Adonoy become short [<b>be restrained</b>]? Now you will see if My words will occur unto you or not.”
Numbers,11,24,"Moshe went out and spoke the words of Adonoy to the people, and he gathered seventy men from the elders of the people and he had them stand around the Tent."
Numbers,11,25,"Adonoy descended [<b>appeared</b>] in a cloud and spoke to him, and He magnified the spirit which was upon him and He gave it unto the seventy men, [who were] the elders. When the spirit [<b>of prophecy</b>] came to rest upon them they prophesied, and they did not cease."
Numbers,11,26,"Two people remained in the camp; one’s name was Eldad and the second one’s name was Meidad. The spirit [<b>of prophecy</b>] rested upon them; they were among those inscribed, and they did not go out to the Tent, and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"The youth ran and told Moshe, and said: “Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"Yehoshua the son of Nun answered, [he being] the attendant of Moshe, from his youth, and he said: “My master Moshe, destroy [<b>bind</b>] them!”"
Numbers,11,29,"Moshe said to him, “Are you vengeful for me? Would (that) it be that all Adonoy’s people were prophets, that Adonoy would give His Spirit upon them.”"
Numbers,11,30,"Moshe entered into the camp, he and the elders of Israel."
Numbers,11,31,"From [<b>before</b>] Adonoy there gusted a wind and He caused quail to fly from the sea and spread them over the camp, about a day’s journey from this side and about a day’s journey from that side, around the camp, and about two <i>amo¯s</i> above the ground’s surface."
Numbers,11,32,"The people arose all of that day, the entire night and the entire next day, and they gathered the quail. He who gathered the least amount, gathered ten heaps and they spread them for themselves around the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"The meat was still between their teeth before it was [even] finished, when the wrath of Adonoy was incited upon the people, and Adonoy smote the people an enormous blow."
Numbers,11,34,"He called the name of that place Kivros Hataavoh [<b>Graves of the Demanders</b>], for it was there that they buried the people who had these cravings."
Numbers,11,35,"From Kivros Hataavoh the people journeyed to Chatzeiros, and they stayed in Chatzeiros."
Numbers,12,1,"Miriam and Aharon spoke about Moshe concerning the Cushite [<b>fair</b>] woman that he married, for, he married [<b>sent away</b>] a Cushite [<b>fair</b>] woman."
Numbers,12,2,They said: “Is it only to Moshe that Adonoy has spoken? Did He not also speak with us?” and [<b>it was heard before</b>] Adonoy heard.
Numbers,12,3,"The man, Moshe [was] most humble, more so than any other person on the face of the earth."
Numbers,12,4,"Adonoy said, suddenly, to Moshe, Aharon and Miriam: “Come out, all three of you, to the Tent of Meeting,” and the three of them went out."
Numbers,12,5,"Adonoy descended [<b>appeared</b>] in a pillar of cloud and He stood at the entrance of the Tent, and He called [to] Aharon and Miriam, and both of them went out."
Numbers,12,6,"He said: “Please listen to My words. If there will be a prophet among you, [I,] Adonoy, will make [<b>reveal</b>] Myself known to him in a vision; in a dream I will speak to him."
Numbers,12,7,"That is not the case with My servant, Moshe; in My entire house he is trusted."
Numbers,12,8,"Mouth [<b>speaker</b>] to mouth [<b>speaker</b>] I speak to [<b>with</b>] him, in a vision and not in riddles; he gazes at the [<b>glorious</b>] likeness of Adonoy; so why are you not afraid to speak about My servant, about Moshe?”"
Numbers,12,9,Adonoy’s anger flared against them and He left.
Numbers,12,10,"The cloud departed from atop the Tent and behold! Miriam became afflicted with <i>tzora’as</i> white as snow; and Aharon turned towards Miriam and behold, she was afflicted with <i>tzora’as.</i>"
Numbers,12,11,"Aharon said to Moshe: “Oh, my master please do not put iniquity upon us for what we have foolishly done and for what we have transgressed."
Numbers,12,12,"Please let her not be like the dead [<b>separated from among us for she is our sister</b>]; That, since he came from his mother’s womb, it would be as half of his own flesh was consumed [<b>pray now for this dead flesh which is in her, so she will be healed</b>].”"
Numbers,12,13,"Moshe cried out [in prayer] to Adonoy, saying: “Please, God, please heal her.”"
Numbers,12,14,"Adonoy said to Moshe: “If her father were to spit in her face [<b>strongly chastise her</b>] would she not be in shame for seven days? She shall be closed off for seven days, beyond the encampment, and after that, she may join again.”"
Numbers,12,15,"Miriam was closed off beyond the encampment for seven days, and the people did not depart until Miriam was brought in to join them."
Numbers,12,16,"After that, the people traveled from Chatzeiros and they camped in the desert of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,"And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Numbers,13,2,"“Send, for yourself, men, and have them scout the Land of Cana’an, which I am giving to Bnei Yisroel; one man, one man each, for his father’s tribe you shall send them, each leader among them.”"
Numbers,13,3,"Moshe sent them from the desert of Paran by the word of Adonoy; all of them [were] men of distinction, they were the heads of Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,13,4,"These are their names; for the tribe of Reuven, Shamua the son of Zaccur."
Numbers,13,5,"For the tribe of Shimon, Shafat the son of Chori."
Numbers,13,6,"For the tribe of Yehudah, Caleiv the son of Yefuneh."
Numbers,13,7,"For the tribe of Yissachar, Yigal the son of Yoseif."
Numbers,13,8,"For the tribe of Ephraim, Hosheiah the son of Nun."
Numbers,13,9,"For the tribe of Binyamin, Palti the son of Raphu."
Numbers,13,10,"For the tribe of Zevulun, Gadiel the son of Sodi."
Numbers,13,11,"For the tribe of Yoseif, for the tribe of Menashe, Gadi the son of Susi."
Numbers,13,12,"For the tribe of Don, Amiel the son of Gemali."
Numbers,13,13,"For the tribe of Asher, Sesur the son of Michael."
Numbers,13,14,"For the tribe of Naftali, Nachbi the son of Vofsi."
Numbers,13,15,"For the tribe of Gad, Geu’el the son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,"These are the names of the men whom Moshe sent to scout the land, and Moshe called Hosheiah the son of Nun, Yehoshua."
Numbers,13,17,"Moshe sent them to scout the land of Cana’an and he said to them: “Go up this [way], to the south and go up to the mountain."
Numbers,13,18,"See what the land is; and the people living on it; are they strong or weak, if they are few or many;"
Numbers,13,19,"and how is the land in which they live, is it good, or bad? And how are the cities in which they reside; are they open, or are they fortified [<b>walled-in</b>]?"
Numbers,13,20,"How is the land (soil) is it fat (rich) or lean (poor), does it have trees, or not? You shall strengthen yourselves, and you shall take some fruit of the land.” Those days were the days of the first ripening of the grapes."
Numbers,13,21,"They went up and they scouted the land from the desert of Tzin until Rechov, at the entrance of Chamas."
Numbers,13,22,"They went up, into the southern part [of the land] and [he] came to Chevron; and there, were Achiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the offspring of the giant[<b>s</b>]. [The city of] Chevron was built seven years before the city of Tzo’an [<b>Tonas</b>] in Egypt."
Numbers,13,23,"They came until the Valley of Eshkol, and from there they cut off a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they carried it between two on a pole, [and they took] some pomegranates and some figs."
Numbers,13,24,"That place they called the Valley of Eshkol, because of the event of the cluster that Bnei Yisroel cut from there."
Numbers,13,25,"They returned from spying the land, at the end of forty days."
Numbers,13,26,"They went and came to Moshe and Aharon and to the entire congregation of Bnei Yisroel [that came] to the desert of Paran, in Kadeish [<b>to Rekom</b>]. They brought word back to them, and to the entire congregation, and they showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"They recounted to him, and they said: “We came into the land into which you sent us, and it indeed flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,"However, the nation is mighty, those who inhabit the land, and the cities are greatly fortified to the utmost, and we also saw the offspring of the giant[<b>s</b>] over there."
Numbers,13,29,"Amalek dwells in the southern part of the land, the Chiti, Yevusi and Emori dwell in the mountain and the Cana’ani dwell by the sea and next to the Yardein.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Caleiv silenced the people to [hear about] Moshe, and he said: “We can surely go up [to the land] and we shall possess it for we are surely able to overcome it.”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who went up with him said: “We are not able to go up against the nation, for they are more powerful than we.”"
Numbers,13,32,"They spread slander about the land that they had scouted, to Bnei Yisroel, saying: “The land through which we have passed to scout it, is a land which consumes [<b>slaughters</b>] its inhabitants; and every one of the people we saw in it, are men of dimensions [<b>stature</b>]."
Numbers,13,33,"There we saw the giants, the sons of the giant [<b>Anok</b>], of the Nephilim [<b>giants</b>], and we were like grasshoppers in our [<b>own</b>] eyes, and so we appeared in their eyes.”"
Numbers,14,1,The entire community arose and raised their voices; and the people wept that night.
Numbers,14,2,"They railed against Moshe and Aharon—all of Bnei Yisroel—and the entire congregation said to them: “Would we had died in the land of Egypt or in this desert, would that we had died."
Numbers,14,3,Why does Adonoy bring us into this land to fall by the sword; our wives and infants would be as spoils; is it not better for us to return to Egypt?”
Numbers,14,4,They said to each other: “Let us appoint (lit. place) a head and we will return to Egypt.”
Numbers,14,5,Moshe and Aharon fell on their faces before the entire gathering of the congregation of Bnei Yisroel.
Numbers,14,6,"Yehoshua the son of Nun and Caleiv the son of Yefuneh, who were among those who scouted the land, tore their clothing [in grief]."
Numbers,14,7,"They said to the entire congregation of Bnei Yisroel, saying: “The land through which we have passed to scout it; that land is very, very good."
Numbers,14,8,"If Adonoy desires us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with [<b>produces</b>] milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"However, do not rebel against [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy and you do not be afraid of the nation of the land, for they are [as] our bread [<b>delivered into our hands</b>], their protection [<b>strength</b>] is removed from them, and [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy is with [<b>supports</b>] us; do not be afraid of them.”"
Numbers,14,10,"The entire congregation said that they should be stoned to death, when the glory of Adonoy appeared in the Tent of Meeting, to all of Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,14,11,"Adonoy said to Moshe: “Until where will this people provoke [<b>before</b>] Me, and how much longer will they have no faith in Me [<b>my word</b>], despite all the signs which I have done in their midst."
Numbers,14,12,I shall smite them with the plague and annihilate them; and I shall make you into a greater and stronger people than they.”
Numbers,14,13,"Moshe said to Adonoy: “But Egypt will hear, that You, in Your might have brought up this people from among them."
Numbers,14,14,"They will say concerning the inhabitants of this land, they have heard that You, Adonoy, are [<b>Your Shechinah dwells</b>] among this people, Who appears to them eye to eye (face to face) [<b>who have seen Your glorious Shechinah</b>], You, Adonoy; Your Cloud stands over them, in a Pillar of Cloud You go before [<b>lead</b>] them daily and in a Pillar of Fire, nightly."
Numbers,14,15,"If You kill this nation like a single man, the nations will say—they who have heard of Your reputation [<b>the fame of Your power</b>]—as follows:"
Numbers,14,16,"“It is because of Adonoy’s inability to bring this people into the land that He swore to them, that he slaughtered [<b>killed</b>] them in the desert.”"
Numbers,14,17,"Now, please, let my Master’s power be enhanced [<b>before Hashem</b>] as You spoke, saying;"
Numbers,14,18,"Adonoy, slow to [<b>distances</b>] anger and abounding in [<b>performing</b>] kindness, forgiving iniquity, [<b>rebellion</b>] and transgression; Who does not completely acquit [<b>pardoning those who return to His Torah, but to those who do not return, He does not acquit</b>], Who will visit the inquities of the fathers upon their [<b>rebellious</b>] children, to the third [generation] and to the fourth [generation.]"
Numbers,14,19,"Please forgive this people according the magnitude of Your kindness, and as You have borne this people since Egypt until this time.”"
Numbers,14,20,"Adonoy said, “I have forgiven them, just as you spoke."
Numbers,14,21,"However, just as I live and the Glory of Adonoy fills the entire land;"
Numbers,14,22,"For, all the people who see My glory and My signs which I have done in Egypt and in the desert, and they have tested [<b>before</b>] Me these ten times and they have not listened to My voice [<b>word</b>]."
Numbers,14,23,If they will see the land that I have sworn to their fathers; all those who angered [<b>before</b>] Me will not see it.
Numbers,14,24,"My servant Caleiv, because he possesed in him a different spirit, and followed Me fully [<b>in fear of Me</b>], I shall bring him into the land to which he came, and his children will cast [its inhabitants] from it."
Numbers,14,25,The Amaleki and the Cana’ani are now dwelling in the valley. Tomorrow turn back and you shall travel the desert by way of the Reed Sea.”
Numbers,14,26,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Numbers,14,27,"“Until when will this wicked congregation [exist], those who provoke Me? The complaints of Bnei Yisroel, which they complain against Me, I have heard [<b>before Me</b>]."
Numbers,14,28,"Say to them: “As I live, says Adonoy, if I do not [do to you] as you have spoken in My ears [<b>before Me</b>]; so I shall do to you."
Numbers,14,29,"In this desert your corpses shall fall, all of you who were counted according to your numbers, from twenty years and above, because you have complained against Me,"
Numbers,14,30,Surely you shall [not] come into the land to which I raised My Hand [to swear] [<b>sworn by My word</b>] that I would cause you to live in it; except for Caleiv the son of Yefuneh and Yehoshua the son of Nun.
Numbers,14,31,"Your infants, about whom you said that they will be as spoils, I shall bring them [there] and they will know the land which you despised."
Numbers,14,32,"Your corpses—yours, shall fall in this desert."
Numbers,14,33,"Your children, they shall be wanderers [<b>delayed</b>] in the desert for forty years, and they will bear [the burden of] your dissoluteness, until the last of your corpses are in the desert."
Numbers,14,34,"According to the number of days which you scouted the land; forty days, a day for a year, a day for a year you will bear the burden of your iniquity forty years, and you will know My displeasure [<b>that you have murmured against Me</b>]."
Numbers,14,35,I am Adonoy; I have spoken—[<b>decreed by My word</b>]—if I do not do this to this entire evil congregation that are gathered against Me; in this desert they shall be finished and there they shall die.”
Numbers,14,36,"Those men whom Moshe sent to scout the land, who returned and provoked the complaints of the entire congregation against him, by spreading slander about the land;"
Numbers,14,37,"Those men died—who spread evil slander against the land—in a plague, before Adonoy."
Numbers,14,38,"Yehoshua the son of Nun and Caleiv the son of Yefuneh, lived, from among those men who went to scout the land."
Numbers,14,39,"Moshe spoke these words to all of Bnei Yisroel, and the people mourned greatly."
Numbers,14,40,"They awoke early in the morning and went up to the peak of the mountain, saying: “We are ready to go up to the place of which Adonoy spoke (promised), for we have sinned.”"
Numbers,14,41,Moshe said: “Why are you now transgressing the word [<b>decree</b>] of Adonoy; it will not succeed.
Numbers,14,42,"Do not go up, for Adonoy is not among you, and do not die before your enemies,"
Numbers,14,43,"For the Amaleki and the Cana’ani are there before you, and you will fall by the sword, for, you turned from following [<b>the service of</b>] Adonoy, and [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy will not be with you [<b>to your aid</b>].”"
Numbers,14,44,"They defiantly went up the mountain peak, but the Ark of the Covenant of Adonoy, and Moshe, did not move from amidst the encampment."
Numbers,14,45,"The Amaleki and the Cana’ani swooped down, they who were dwelling in that mountain, and they smote and crushed [<b>persued</b>] them until Chormah."
Numbers,15,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Numbers,15,2,"“Speak to Bnei Yisroel, and say to them, when you arrive into the land in which you will dwell, which I am giving to you."
Numbers,15,3,"When you make a fire-offering [<b>sacrifice</b>] to Adonoy, a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, by verbalizing as a pledge or as a donation or on your festivals to provide a pleasing fragrance to [<b>to be accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy, from cattle or from sheep."
Numbers,15,4,"The one bringing his offering to Adonoy shall present one tenth of flour mixed with one fourth of a <i>hin</i> of oil,"
Numbers,15,5,"Along with wine, for a wine-offering, one fourth of a <i>hin,</i> so you shall do for a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, for the one sheep."
Numbers,15,6,"If for a ram you shall make a meal-offering of two tenths, mixed with one third of a <i>hin</i> of oil."
Numbers,15,7,"Wine, for a wine-offering shall be one third of a <i>hin.</i> This is how you shall offer a pleasing fragrance to [<b>to be accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy."
Numbers,15,8,"If you are making a calf as a burnt-offering or sacrifice by verbalizing as a pledge or for a peace-offering, to Adonoy."
Numbers,15,9,Along with the calf he shall bring a meal-offering of three tenths mixed with one half of a <i>hin</i> of oil.
Numbers,15,10,"You shall bring wine, for a wine-offering, one half of a <i>hin,</i> a fire-offering of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which will be accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy."
Numbers,15,11,So you shall do for each ox or ram or for the sheep or goats.
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number, which you offer, so you shall make for each one according to the[ir] number[s]."
Numbers,15,13,"Each citizen shall do this as stated, to bring a fire-offering of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which will be accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy."
Numbers,15,14,"If a proselyte will live with you or among you, for all of your generations and makes a fire-offering of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which will be accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy, in the same fashion as you make it, so shall he make it."
Numbers,15,15,"The assembly has one statute for yourselves and for the proselyte who resides; one statue for all of your generations, just as it is for yourselves, so shall it be for the proselyte, before Adonoy."
Numbers,15,16,"One law and one rule will apply to you, and to the proselyte who lives with you.”"
Numbers,15,17,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,15,18,"“Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them, at your coming to the land into which I am bringing you,"
Numbers,15,19,When you eat from the bread of the land you shall separate a <i>terumah</i> for [<b>a separation before</b>] Adonoy.
Numbers,15,20,"[From] the first portion of your doughs you shall separate a loaf as a separated portion; like the <i>terumah</i>-gift of the granary, so shall you separate it."
Numbers,15,21,"Of the first portion of your doughs you shall give to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy as a <i>terumah</i>- offering, throughout your generations.”"
Numbers,15,22,"If you should err, and not fulfill all of these commandments which Adonoy said to Moshe;"
Numbers,15,23,"All that Adonoy commanded you through Moshe, from the day on which Adonoy commanded, and from then on, throughout your generations."
Numbers,15,24,"If it was obscured from the eyes of the congregation, having been done in error, then the entire congregation shall offer one young bullock as a burnt-offering for a pleasing fragrance to [<b>to be accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy. Its meal-offering and its wine-offering are according to its law, and one he-goat, as a sin-offering."
Numbers,15,25,"The <i>kohein</i> shall atone on behalf of the entire congregation of Bnei Yisroel, and they shall be forgiven; for they have erred unwittingly and they have brought their offering, as a fire-offering to Adonoy, and their sin-offering before Adonoy (to atone) for their error."
Numbers,15,26,And it shall be forgiven to the entire congregation of Bnei Yisroel and the stranger amongst them; for the entire people sinned unintentionally.
Numbers,15,27,"If one person will sin erroneously, that person shall bring a yearling she-goat as a sin-offering."
Numbers,15,28,"The <i>kohein</i> shall atone for that erring soul which has sinned unwittingly before Adonoy; to achieve atonement for him, and he will be forgiven."
Numbers,15,29,"[For] the citizen among Bnei Yisroel, and the proselyte who dwells among them there shall be one law for you all, for he who sins unwittingly."
Numbers,15,30,"A person who commits a sin high-handedly [<b>publicly</b>] among the citizens or among the proselytes, blasphemes [<b>provokes before</b>] Adonoy; the soul of that person shall be cut off from among its people."
Numbers,15,31,For he has denigrated the word of Adonoy and he has violated His commandment; The soul of that person shall certainly be cut off; its iniquity is upon it.
Numbers,15,32,"Bnei Yisroel were in the desert, and they found a man gathering wood on the day of the Shabbos."
Numbers,15,33,"Those who found him brought him near—he who was gathering wood—to Moshe and to Aharon, and to the entire congregation."
Numbers,15,34,"They placed [<b>bound</b>] him under guard since it was not specified, what was to be done to him."
Numbers,15,35,"Adonoy said to Moshe: “That man shall be put to death, the entire congregation shall stone him beyond the encampment.”"
Numbers,15,36,"The entire congregation brought him outside beyond the encampment, and they stoned him with stones, and he died, just as Adonoy commanded Moshe."
Numbers,15,37,"And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,15,38,"Speak to Bnei Yisroel and tell them to make for themselves, <i>tzizis</i>-fringes on the corners of their garments—throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue."
Numbers,15,39,And it will be to you for fringes and you will look upon it and you will remember all of Adonoy’s commandments and you will perform them; and you will not search [<b>stray</b>] after [the desire of] your hearts and after [<b>the sight</b>] your eyes which cause you to go astray.
Numbers,15,40,In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto [<b>before</b>] your God.
Numbers,15,41,"I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am Adonoy your God."
Numbers,16,1,"Korach took [<b>divided</b>], [Korach], the son of Yitzhar the son of Kehos, the son of Levi, and Dasan and Aviram the sons of Eliav, and On the son of Peles, the sons of Reuvein."
Numbers,16,2,"They rose up before Moshe with men from Bnei Yisroel [numbering] two hundred and fifty, who were the leaders of the congregation, those who were called to meetings, men of [prominent] name."
Numbers,16,3,"They gathered against Moshe and Aharon, and they said to them: “You have [taken] too much for yourselves [and] since the entire congregation are all holy and Adonoy is [<b>the Shechinah of Hashem dwells</b>] in their midst, why do [<b>what is this that</b>] you raise yourselves above the assembly of Adonoy?”"
Numbers,16,4,"Moshe heard, and he fell upon his face."
Numbers,16,5,"He spoke to Korach and to his entire congregation, saying: “[In the] morning, Adonoy will make known who is [<b>qualified to be</b>] His, and who is holy, He will bring close to Him; and whoever He chooses, He will bring near to Him [<b>to His service</b>]."
Numbers,16,6,"Do this: Take, for yourselves, fire pans, Korach and his entire congregation,"
Numbers,16,7,"and place fire in them and put [<b>fragrant</b>] incense upon them before Adonoy, tomorrow; and it will be that the man who will be chosen by Adonoy, he is the holy one; [you have taken] too much upon yourselves, sons of Levi.”"
Numbers,16,8,"Moshe said to Korach, “Please listen sons of Levi,"
Numbers,16,9,"is it but a pittance for yourselves that the God of Israel has separated you from the [rest of the] congregation of Israel to bring you closer to [<b>before</b>] Him to perform the services of the <i>Mishkan</i> of Adonoy, and to stand before the congregation to serve them?"
Numbers,16,10,"He brought you near with all of your brethren the sons of Levi with you, and yet [<b>now</b>] you ask to be <i>kohanim</i> [<b>Kohein Gadol</b>] as well?"
Numbers,16,11,"Therefore, you and your entire congregation who are gathered against Adonoy; and what is Aharon that you rail against him?”"
Numbers,16,12,Moshe sent to call for Dasan and Avirom the sons of Eliav and they said “We will not go up.
Numbers,16,13,"Is it but a pittance that you have brought us up from a land flowing with [<b>that produces</b>] milk and honey to kill us in the desert, that you must excercise power over us to make yourself powerful as well?"
Numbers,16,14,"Even into a land flowing with [<b>that produces</b>] milk and honey you have not brought us, and [not] given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards if you put those people’s eyes out, [even then] we would not go up.”"
Numbers,16,15,"Moshe was extremely distressed, and said to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy: “Do not turn to [<b>accept</b>] their offering [<b>with pleasure</b>]; not a donkey did I sequester from any one of them nor have I done ill to any one of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"Moshe said to Korach: “You and your entire congregation will be before Adonoy, you, and they, and Aharon, tomorrow."
Numbers,16,17,"Each man will take his firepan and place [<b>fragrant</b>] incense in them and you will offer before Adonoy each man his firepan, two hundred and fifty firepans, and you and Aharon will each take his own firepan.”"
Numbers,16,18,Each man took his firepan and they placed fire in them and they put [<b>fragrant</b>] incense in them and they stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting along with Moshe and Aharon.
Numbers,16,19,"Korach congregated against them, the entire congregation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Adonoy appeared to the entire congregation."
Numbers,16,20,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Numbers,16,21,"“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, and I will annihalate them in an instant.”"
Numbers,16,22,"They fell upon their faces, and they said: “Almighty, the God of the spirits of all flesh; if one man sins shall You be angry with the entire congregation?”"
Numbers,16,23,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,16,24,"Speak to the congregation, saying: “Depart from the vicinity of the dwelling of Korach, Dasan and Avirom.”"
Numbers,16,25,Moshe rose up and went to Dasan and Avirom and the elders of Israel went along after him.
Numbers,16,26,"He spoke to the congregation, saying: “Please get away from the tents of these evil [<b>guilty</b>] men, and do not touch [<b>come near</b>] anything belonging to them, lest you be swept away [<b>smitten</b>] in all their transgressions.”"
Numbers,16,27,"They withdraw from the dwelling of Korach, Dasan and Avirom, and all around; and Dasan and Avirom went out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, children and infants."
Numbers,16,28,"Moshe said: “This is how you will know that Adonoy has sent me to perform all of these deeds, for, I did not devise them myself [<b>from my own will</b>]."
Numbers,16,29,"If as all men die will these men meet their deaths, and the reckoning (fate) of all men will be reckoned upon them, then Adonoy has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"If Adonoy will create a [new] creation and the ground will open its mouth and swallow them along with all of their belongings, and they will go down alive to the grave, then you will know that these men have angered Adonoy.”"
Numbers,16,31,As he was finishing speaking all these words the ground beneath them split.
Numbers,16,32,The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their houses [<b>household members</b>] and all the people belonging to Korach and all of the possessions.
Numbers,16,33,"They, and all belonging to them, went down alive to the grave, and the earth covered them and they perished from among the assembly."
Numbers,16,34,"All of Yisroel who were around them fled from their uproar, for they said, perhaps the earth will swallow us."
Numbers,16,35,A fire came forth from [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were bringing the [<b>fragrant</b>] incense.
Numbers,17,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;"
Numbers,17,2,"“Say to Elazar the son of Aharon, the <i>kohein</i> and have him lift up the firepans from the inferno, and you, scatter the fire yonder, for, they were sanctified;"
Numbers,17,3,"[These] firepans of these sinners [who paid] with their souls, and make them into hammered sheets to overlay the altar, for they were brought in offering before Adonoy and they were sanctified; and they shall be for a sign for Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,17,4,"Elazar the <i>kohein,</i> took the copper firepans, those that the fire victims brought and hammered them into a covering for the altar,"
Numbers,17,5,"to be a reminder for Bnei Yisroel so that a commoner shall never offer, one who is not a descendant of Aharon, to burn [<b>fragrant</b>] incense before Adonoy; so as not to be like Korach and his congregation; as Adonoy spoke to him, through Moshe."
Numbers,17,6,"They complained—the entire congregation of Bnei Yisroel—on the next day against Moshe and Aharon, saying: “You have killed [<b>caused the death</b>] the people of Adonoy”"
Numbers,17,7,"When the congregation assembled against Moshe and Aharon, they turned to the Tent of Meeting and behold! The cloud covered it, and the Glory of Adonoy appeared."
Numbers,17,8,Moshe and Aharon came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,17,9,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,17,10,"“Remove [<b>separate</b>] yourselves from this congregation and I shall annihalate them in an instant,” and they fell upon their faces."
Numbers,17,11,"Moshe said to Aharon: “Take the firepan and put fire from atop the altar on it and place [<b>fragrant</b>] incense on it, and go quickly to the congregation and atone for them, for anger has come forth from before Adonoy; the plague has commenced.”"
Numbers,17,12,"Aharon took, just as Moshe spoke, and he ran to the middle of the assembly and behold! The plague had commenced among the people. He put on incense and he atoned for the people."
Numbers,17,13,He stood between the dead and between the living and the plague was halted [<b>ceased</b>].
Numbers,17,14,"The dead in the plague totaled fourteen thousand seven hundred, excluding those who died due to Korach’s rebellion [<b>division</b>]."
Numbers,17,15,Aharon returned to Moshe to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and the plague was halted.
Numbers,17,16,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,17,17,"“Speak to Bnei Yisroel and take from among them a staff, a staff for each father’s [tribal] house, from all the leaders according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staffs; and you shall write each man’s name on his staff."
Numbers,17,18,"You shall write the name of Aharon on the staff of Levi, for, [there is] one staff for the head of their fathers’ house."
Numbers,17,19,You shall leave them inside the Tent of Meeting before the testimony where there I [<b>My word</b>] meet you.
Numbers,17,20,"It shall be that the man whom I choose, his staff shall blossom; and I will abate from Myself [<b>before Me</b>] the complaints of Bnei Yisroel that they complain against you.”"
Numbers,17,21,"Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisroel and all the leaders gave to him a staff for each leader; a staff for each leader, according to their fathers’ house, twelve staffs, and the staff of Aharon [was] among their staffs."
Numbers,17,22,Moshe placed the staffs before Adonoy in the Tent of the Testimony.
Numbers,17,23,"It was on the next day, Moshe came inside the Tent of the Testimony, and behold! The staff of Aharon blossomed for the house of Levi, a blossom came forth, and bloomed buds and bore ripe almonds."
Numbers,17,24,"Moshe then brought out all the staffs from before Adonoy to all Bnei Yisroel, and each (man) saw [<b>recognized</b>], and retrieved his staff."
Numbers,17,25,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Return the staff of Aharon before the (Ark of) Testimony to be preserved as a symbol to the rebellious people, so that their complaint will end [<b>from before Me</b>] and they not die.”"
Numbers,17,26,"Moshe did (this), as Adonoy commanded him—so he did."
Numbers,17,27,"Bnei Yisroel said [the following] to Moshe: “Behold, we perish, we are lost—we are all lost [<b>killed by sword, some of us swallowed by the earth, some of us perish by plague</b>]."
Numbers,17,28,"Anyone approaching, who comes close to the Mishkon of Adonoy will die—have we been consigned to die?”"
Numbers,18,1,"Adonoy said to Aharon: “You, your sons, and your father’s house with you will bear the sin of the Sanctuary, and you, and your sons with you will bear the sin of your <i>kehunah</i>."
Numbers,18,2,"Also, your brothers, the tribe of Levi—the tribe of your father—bring to you, and they shall join you, and serve you, you and your sons with you, before the Tent of Testimony."
Numbers,18,3,"They shall guard their duties to you and all the duties of the Tent, but to the holy furniture or to the Altar they must not approach, that neither they, nor you, shall die."
Numbers,18,4,"They shall join you and guard the duties of the Tent of Meeting—all the service of the Tent, but a commoner, [a non-<i>kohein</i>] should not approach you."
Numbers,18,5,"You shall discharge the sacred duties and the duties of the Altar, so that there will be no more wrath on Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,18,6,"Behold, I have brought your brothers the Levites from among Bnei Yisroel, given to you as a gift—for [<b>before</b>] Adonoy—to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting."
Numbers,18,7,"You and your sons with you shall guard your <i>kehunah</i> [duties] regarding the Altar and all that is within the Curtain—you shall serve—the service, as a gift, I give the <i>kehunah</i> to you, and the commoner who approaches shall be killed.”"
Numbers,18,8,"Adonoy spoke to Aharon: “Behold I have given you the guarding of my <i>terumah</i>-gifts, and all the hallowed things of Bnei Yisroel, to you and your children I give them for consecration, as a portion forever."
Numbers,18,9,"This is yours from the most holy [<b>that remain</b>] from the fire, [of] all their sacrifices—their <i>minchah</i>-offerings, their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings which they return to [<b>before</b>] Me shall be most holy to you and your sons."
Numbers,18,10,"You shall eat it in the supremely holy (place), every male may eat it—it shall be holy to you."
Numbers,18,11,"Their <i>terumah</i>-gift is yours, of all of the wave-offerings of Bnei Yisroel I give to you and to your sons and daughters that are with you as an everlasting portion; all those ritually pure in your house may eat it."
Numbers,18,12,"The best of the oil, and the best of the wine and grain—their <i>terumah</i>-gift that they present to Adonoy—I have given to you."
Numbers,18,13,"The first fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring before Adonoy, shall be yours; all those ritually pure in your house may eat it."
Numbers,18,14,Everything consecrated in Israel shall be yours.
Numbers,18,15,Every firstling [<b>all that open the womb</b>] of every being which they offer before Adonoy—man or beast—shall be yours; but you must redeem the firstborn of man and redeem the firstborn of unclean beasts.
Numbers,18,16,Its redemption—from a month old you should redeem them—the valuation is five silver <i>sela’im</i> of holy silver <i>shekalim</i> which is twenty <i>gerah.</i>
Numbers,18,17,"However, a firstborn ox, a firstborn sheep or firstborn goat do not redeem because they are holy; sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fats as a fire-offering as a pleasing fragrance to [<b>accepted with pleasure before</b>] Adonoy."
Numbers,18,18,Their flesh is yours; like the breast which is waved and like the right thigh—it shall be yours.
Numbers,18,19,"All of the sacred <i>terumah</i>-gifts that Bnei Yisroel offer to Adonoy, I have given to you, your sons and daughters with you as an everlasting portion; an eternal covenant of salt before Adonoy to you and your children that are with you.”"
Numbers,18,20,"Adonoy said to Aharon: “You will have no inheritance in their land, and you will not have a share among them; I am [<b>the gift that I have given you is</b>] your inheritance and portion among Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,18,21,"Behold, I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they perform—the service of the Tent of Meeting."
Numbers,18,22,"Bnei Yisroel shall no longer approach the Tent of Meeting, to become guilty and die."
Numbers,18,23,The Levi[tes]—[they] shall perform the service of the Tent of Meeting and they will bear their guilt; it is an everlasting decree—throughout your generations—among Bnei Yisroel they (the Levites) shall have no inheritance.
Numbers,18,24,"For the tithe of Bnei Yisroel which they must set aside to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy as a <i>terumah</i>-gift I gave to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore, I told them: ‘among Bnei Yisroel they shall have no inheritance.’”"
Numbers,18,25,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,18,26,"“Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘When you take the tithe from Bnei Yisroel, which I gave you from them for your inheritance, set aside from it the <i>terumah</i>-gift of [<b>separation before</b>] Adonoy, a tithe of the tithe."
Numbers,18,27,Your <i>terumah</i>-gift [<b>separation</b>] will be considered the same as grain from the granary and [wine and oil of] fully ripened fruit from the cistern.
Numbers,18,28,"So must you, too, set aside the <i>terumah</i>-gift of Adonoy from all your tithes which you take from Bnei Yisroel; give from them the <i>terumah</i>-gift of [<b>separation before</b>] Adonoy to Aharon the <i>kohein.</i>"
Numbers,18,29,From all your gifts you must set aside all of the <i>terumah</i>-gifts [<b>separations</b>] of Adonoy; from each thing—its finest part—the part that is to be consecrated.’
Numbers,18,30,"Say to them: ‘When you set aside the finest part of it, it will be considered for the Levites like the produce of the granary and the produce of the cistern."
Numbers,18,31,You may consume it anywhere—you and [<b>the members of</b>] your household; since it is the reward for your service in the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers,18,32,"You will not bear a sin because of it, when you separate its best part; but sacred things of Bnei Yisroel you must not profane, and you will not die.”’"
Numbers,19,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe and Aharon, saying."
Numbers,19,2,"This is the statute of the Torah which Adonoy commanded, saying; speak to Bnei Yisroel that they shall take to you a red, perfect cow without a blemish, upon which no yoke was laid."
Numbers,19,3,"Give it to Elozor the <i>kohein</i>; he shall take it outside the camp, and someone shall slaughter it in his presence."
Numbers,19,4,"Elozor the <i>kohein</i> shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it directly facing the Tent of Meeting, some of its blood seven times."
Numbers,19,5,"Someone shall burn the cow in his presence; its skin, flesh, blood, with its waste (that are in its intestines) shall be burned."
Numbers,19,6,"The <i>kohein</i> shall take a piece of cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson wool, and throw them into the burning of the cow."
Numbers,19,7,"Then the <i>kohein</i> shall wash his garments and bathe his body in water, and afterwards he may enter the camp; [however,] the <i>kohein</i> shall be impure until the evening."
Numbers,19,8,"Also, the one who burns it must wash his garments and bathe his body in water; he shall remain unclean until the evening."
Numbers,19,9,A ritually clean person shall gather the cow’s ashes and place [it] outside the camp in a clean place; it shall remain a keepsake for the community of Bnei Yisroel for sprinkling water for purification.
Numbers,19,10,"The one who gathers the cow’s ashes shall wash his garments, and remain unclean until the evening; it shall be for Bnei Yisroel and for the proselyte who lives among them an eternal statute."
Numbers,19,11,One who touches the corpse of any [human] soul shall become unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"He shall cleanse himself [<b>be sprinked</b>] with it on the third day and on the seventh day, so that he may become clean; if he does not have himself cleansed [<b>be sprinked</b>] on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Whoever touches a corpse of a [human] soul, who died and does not have himself cleansed [<b>be sprinked</b>] defiles the <i>Mishkan</i> of Adonoy (if he enters it), that soul will be cut off from Yisroel; because the sprinkling water was not sprinkled on him, he will be impure his impurity remains."
Numbers,19,14,This is the law [regarding] a person who dies in a tent; anyone who enters the tent and everything that is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,15,"Any open [<b>earthenware</b>] utensil that has no cover fastened to it, shall be unclean."
Numbers,19,16,"Anyone who touches, in an open field, one slain by the sword, a corpse, human bone, or grave, shall be unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,17,They shall take for the unclean person of the ashes from the burnt purification-offering and he shall place upon them living [spring] water in a vessel.
Numbers,19,18,"He shall take hyssop and dip it into the water; [this is done by] a ritually clean person, he shall sprinkle it on the tent, on all the utensils and people that were there, and on anyone who touched the bone, murder victim, corpse, or grave."
Numbers,19,19,"The ritually clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day; he shall purify him on the seventh day when he must wash his garments and bathe in water, and then he becomes clean in the evening."
Numbers,19,20,"A person who became ritually unclean [and enters the Sanctuary] without purifying himself [<b>being sprinkled</b>], that soul [<b>person</b>] will be cut off from the community; for he defiled the Sanctuary of Adonoy, the sprinkling water was not sprinkled upon him, he remains unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"This shall be the statute for all times; one who sprinkles the sprinkling waters shall wash his garments, and one who touches the sprinkling waters shall remain unclean until the evening."
Numbers,19,22,"Anything which the unclean person touches, shall become unclean; and anyone touching him shall be ritually unclean until the evening."
Numbers,20,1,"The entire community of Bnei Yisroel came to the wilderness of Tzin, in the first month. The people settled in Kodeish [<b>Rekom</b>], and Miriam died and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,"There was no water for the community, and they assembled against Moshe and Aharon."
Numbers,20,3,"The people quarreled with Moshe and said, “Would that we had died by our brothers’ death before Adonoy."
Numbers,20,4,Why did you bring the congregation of Adonoy into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die there?
Numbers,20,5,"Why did you take us out of Egypt and bring us to this terrible place? It is not a place [<b>fit</b>] for seed, [<b>nor for</b>] figs, grapes, or pomegranates; and there is no water to drink!”"
Numbers,20,6,"Moshe and Aharon moved away from the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces; the glory of Adonoy appeared to them."
Numbers,20,7,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying."
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the staff and assemble the community, you and Aharon your brother, and speak to the rock in their presence that it may give forth its water; you will then bring forth for them water from the rock, and give drink [to] the community and their livestock.”"
Numbers,20,9,"Moshe took the staff from before Adonoy, as He instructed him."
Numbers,20,10,"Moshe and Aharon assembled the community before the rock; [Moshe] said to them, “Listen, you rebels! Can we extract water from this rock for you?”"
Numbers,20,11,"And Moshe raised his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice; water rushed out abundantly, and the community and their livestock drank."
Numbers,20,12,"Adonoy said to Moshe and Aharon, “Because you did not believe in Me [<b>My word</b>] to sanctify Me in the presence of Bnei Yisroel; therefore, you will not bring this congregation into the land that I have given them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"They are the waters of dispute where Bnei Yisroel contended with [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, and He was sanctified through them."
Numbers,20,14,"Moshe sent emissaries from Kodeish [<b>Rekom</b>] to the King of Edom (saying), “This is what your brother Yisroel declares; you know of all the hardship that we have encountered."
Numbers,20,15,Our forefathers went down to Egypt and we remained in Egypt for a long time; the Egyptians mistreated us and our forefathers.
Numbers,20,16,"Then we cried out [<b>prayed</b>] to Adonoy, and He heard our voice [<b>accept our prayer</b>], He sent an emissary and led us out of Egypt; now we are in Kodeish [<b>Rekom</b>], a city at the edge of your border."
Numbers,20,17,"Please let us pass through your land, we will not pass through any field or vineyard, and we will not drink well water; we will travel by the king’s road, we will not turn aside to the right or left, until we have passed through your territory.”"
Numbers,20,18,"Edom responded, “You shall not pass through me (my land) [<b>my border</b>], lest I go out against you [<b>to kill you</b>] with the sword!”"
Numbers,20,19,"Bnei Yisroel said, “We will go up by the [<b>paved</b>] highway, and if we or our cattle drink your water we will pay for it, it is just nothing, we only want [<b>with no evil intent</b>] to pass through on foot.”"
Numbers,20,20,"Then (Edom) responded, “Do not pass through!” Edom came to confront [Bnei Yisroel] with a massive number of people [<b>an army</b>] and a strong hand."
Numbers,20,21,"Edom refused to allow Yisroel to pass through its territory, and Yisroel turned aside from him."
Numbers,20,22,"They traveled from Kodeish, and the entire community of Bnei Yisroel came to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe and Aharon at Mount Hor, at the border of the land of Edom, saying."
Numbers,20,24,"“Aharon will now be gathered (die) to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to Bnei Yisroel, because you defied My word at the waters of dispute."
Numbers,20,25,"Take Aharon and his son Elozor, and bring them up to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,26,Remove Aharon’s vestments and dress his son Elozor in them; Aharon will be gathered in and die there.”
Numbers,20,27,Moshe did as Adonoy commanded; and they went up Mount Hor in the presence of the entire community.
Numbers,20,28,"Moshe then removed Aharon’s vestments and dressed Aharon’s son, Elozor, in them; Aharon died there on top of the mountain, and Moshe and Elozor descended from the mountain."
Numbers,20,29,"The entire community saw that Aharon died; and they wept for Aharon thirty days, the entire house of Yisroel."
Numbers,21,1,"The Canaanite King of Arad heard—who lived in the south—that Yisroel had come by the route of the spies; he attacked [<b>waged war with</b>] Yisroel, and he took from them a captive."
Numbers,21,2,"Yisroel made a vow to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and said, “If You will deliver this people into my hand, I shall consecrate their cities.”"
Numbers,21,3,"Adonoy heard Yisroel’s voice [<b>prayers</b>], and He delivered the Canaanites (into Yisroel’s hand), and he (Yisroel) destroyed them and [consecrated] their cities; the region was named Chormo."
Numbers,21,4,"They then traveled from Mount Hor by the Reed Sea route, in order to circle around the land of Edom; traveling was insufferable to the [<b>soul of the</b>] people."
Numbers,21,5,"The people spoke out [<b>complained</b>] against [<b>the word of</b>] God and [<b>they fought</b>] Moshe, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no food and no water, and we are disgusted with this rotten bread [<b>which is eaten simply</b>].”"
Numbers,21,6,"Adonoy sent against the people the consuming snakes, and they bit the people, and many people of Yisroel died."
Numbers,21,7,"The people came to Moshe and said, “We have sinned by speaking against [<b>complaining before</b>] Adonoy and [<b>fighting with</b>] you; pray to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy that He remove the snakes from us.” Moshe prayed on behalf of the people."
Numbers,21,8,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Make yourself [the image of] a consuming snake, and place it upon a banner; and anyone bitten will look at it and live.”"
Numbers,21,9,"Moshe made a copper snake and placed it on the banner; whenever a snake bit a person, he would gaze upon the copper snake and live."
Numbers,21,10,Bnei Yisroel traveled on and camped in Ovos.
Numbers,21,11,"They traveled from Ovos and camped in the wasteland passes in the wilderness, facing Moav, eastward of the sun."
Numbers,21,12,They traveled from there and camped in the valley of Zered.
Numbers,21,13,"They traveled from there and camped opposite Arnon, in the wilderness, extending from the Emorite border; Arnon being the Moav border between Moav and the Emorite."
Numbers,21,14,"Concerning this will be told in the Book of the Wars of Adonoy, “He gave at the Reeds (Sea) and [<b>the might at</b>] the valleys of Arnon."
Numbers,21,15,"And the spillage in the valleys when it turned to dwell at Ar, and then leaned on the border of Moav."
Numbers,21,16,"From there, to the well; this is the well of which Adonoy said to Moshe, ‘Gather the people and I will give them water.’”"
Numbers,21,17,"It was then that Yisroel sang this song [<b>of praise</b>]: “Arise, O well, sing to it!"
Numbers,21,18,"The well dug by princes, that the nobles of the nation excavated, through the lawgiver, with their staffs; from the wilderness a gift [<b>was given to them</b>]."
Numbers,21,19,"The gift [<b>given to them</b>] (traveled) to the valley, and from the valley [<b>rose with them</b>] to the heights."
Numbers,21,20,"And from the heights to the valley that is in the field of Moav, at the top of the peak that overlooks the wastelands.”"
Numbers,21,21,"Yisroel sent emissaries to Sichon, King of the Emorite, saying."
Numbers,21,22,"“Let me pass through your land, we will not turn aside into the fields and vineyards, we will not drink well water; we will go by the King’s road until we have passed through your territory.”"
Numbers,21,23,But Sichon did not allow Yisroel to pass through his territory; Sichon gathered all his people and went out against Yisroel to the wilderness; he came to Yohatz and attacked [<b>waged war with</b>] Yisroel.
Numbers,21,24,"Yisroel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land; from Arnon to the Yabok, as far as Amon[’s border], because Amon’s border was impregnable."
Numbers,21,25,"Yisroel took [<b>captured</b>] all these cities; Yisroel settled in all the cities of the Emorite, in Cheshbon and all its daughters [<b>villages</b>]."
Numbers,21,26,"For Cheshbon was then a city of Sichon, King of the Emorites, and he had waged war against the first king of Moav, and took all his land from his hand, as far as Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Concerning this, the parable tellers say: “Come to Cheshbon, may it be built and established as the city of Sichon."
Numbers,21,28,"For [<b>an Easterly wind as strong as</b>] a fire went forth from Cheshbon, [<b>waged war as</b>] a flame from Sichon’s capital; it consumed [<b>killing the nation that dwelled in</b>] Ar [<b>Lechoyas</b>], of Moav, [<b>killing</b>] the masters [<b>priests who serve in the house of idol worship</b>] of Arnon’s heights."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to you, O Moav, you are destroyed, people of [<b>who serve</b>] Kemosh, he rendered your sons as refugees, and your daughters captives, of Sichon, King of Emori."
Numbers,21,30,Their kingdom was uprooted from Cheshbon as far as Divon [<b>whose reign has ended</b>]; we made them desolate as far as Nofach near Meidva.”
Numbers,21,31,Yisroel settled in the land of the Emorite.
Numbers,21,32,"Moshe sent [men] to spy on Ya’zer, and they captured its surrounding villages, and drove out the Emorites that were there."
Numbers,21,33,"They then turned and headed toward the Bashan [<b>Masnon</b>]; and Og, King of the Bashan [<b>Masnon</b>], came out against them he with all his people, to wage war at Edre’i."
Numbers,21,34,"Adonoy said to Moshe, “Do not be afraid of him, for into your hand I have delivered Ihim and all his people and territory; do to him as you have done to Sichon, King of the Emorite, who lives in Cheshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"And they killed him (Og), his sons, and all his people, leaving no survivors; and they took possession of his land."
Numbers,22,1,"Bnei Yisroel traveled and camped in the western plains of Moav, across the Yardein from Yereicho."
Numbers,22,2,And Balak the son of Tzipor saw all that Yisroel had done to the Emorite.
Numbers,22,3,"And Moav became terrified of the people [of Israel] because of their great numbers, and so, Moav detested the Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,22,4,"Moav said to the elders of Midian, “Now this assembly will lick up [<b>consume</b>] everything around us, just as the ox laps up the herbs of the field.” Balak the son of Tzipor was King of Moav at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"He sent emissaries to Bil’am the son of Beor, to Pesor—which is by the river [<b>Peras</b>], the land of his people—to call him, saying: “Behold, a nation came out of Egypt, behold they have covered [<b>obscured the sunshine from</b>] the face of the earth, and is located across from me."
Numbers,22,6,"And now, please come and curse this nation for me, for it is too mighty for me, perhaps it will enable us to strike at [<b>wage war with</b>] him, and banish them from the land; for I know, that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed.”"
Numbers,22,7,And the elders of Moav and Midian went with magic charms in their hands; they came to Bil’am and conveyed Balak's message to him.
Numbers,22,8,"He replied to them: “Spend this night here and then I will give you an answer according to what Adonoy tells me,’’ and the dignitaries of Moav remained with Bil’am."
Numbers,22,9,"God[<b>’s word</b>] appeared to [<b>before</b>] Bil’am and said, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"Bil’am replied to God: “Balak son of Tzipor, King of Moav, has sent them to me [saying]:"
Numbers,22,11,"‘Behold, the people that came out of Egypt has covered [<b>obscured the sunshine from</b>] the face of the earth; come now, and curse him for me so that I will be able to wage war against him, and banish him’.”"
Numbers,22,12,"God said to Bil’am: “Do not go with them! You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”"
Numbers,22,13,"Bil’am arose in the morning and said to Balak's dignitaries: “Go back to your land, for Adonoy refuses [<b>it is not the will of Hashem</b>] to allow me to go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"Moav's dignitaries got up, and came to Balak and said: “Bil’am refuses to go with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,Balak persisted and sent dignitaries in greater number and of higher rank than these.
Numbers,22,16,They came to Bil’am and said to him: “The following is a message from Balak the son Tzipor: ‘Please do not refuse to come to me.
Numbers,22,17,"For I will honor you greatly and whatever you tell me, I will do, if you would just please come and curse this people for me.’”"
Numbers,22,18,"Bil’am answered and said to Balak's servants: “Even if Balak would give me silver and gold enough to fill his house, I cannot [<b>have no permission</b>] transgress the word of Adonoy my God, by doing anything small or great."
Numbers,22,19,"Now, you also, please remain here overnight, and I will get to know what more will Adonoy tell me.”"
Numbers,22,20,"God[<b>’s word</b>] appeared [<b>before</b>] to Bil’am that night and said to him: “If the men have come to call you, arise and go with them; however, whatever I will say to you, you will do.”"
Numbers,22,21,"Bil’am arose in the morning, saddled [<b>readied</b>] his donkey, and went with the Moavite dignitaries."
Numbers,22,22,"God showed anger because he went, and an angel of Adonoy placed himself in the way to thwart him, as he was riding on his donkey accompanied by his two attendants."
Numbers,22,23,The donkey saw the angel of Adonoy standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand; the donkey turned aside from the way and went into the field; Bil’am struck the donkey to get it back on the way.
Numbers,22,24,But the angel of Adonoy stood in a narrow path of the vineyards [<b>at a place</b>] with a barrier at either side.
Numbers,22,25,"When the donkey saw the angel of Adonoy, she was pressed against the wall and pressed Bil’am's foot against the wall; and he struck her even more."
Numbers,22,26,"Adonoy’s angel passed further ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no room to turn [either] to the right or to the left."
Numbers,22,27,"When the donkey saw the angel of Adonoy, it crouched beneath Bil’am; Bil’am[<b>’s anger was provoked</b>] became angry and beat the donkey with the stick."
Numbers,22,28,"Adonoy opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Bil’am: “What have I done to you, that you have hit me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Bil’am said to the donkey: “Because you have ridiculed me; would that I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you now.”"
Numbers,22,30,The donkey replied to Bil’am: “Am I not the very same donkey that you have been riding on all your life [<b>from the time I became yours</b>] until this very day? Was it ever my habit to do this to you?” And he said: “No.”
Numbers,22,31,"Adonoy then enabled Bil’am to see, and he observed the angel of Adonoy standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand. He bowed his head and prostrated himself on his face."
Numbers,22,32,"The angel of Adonoy said to him: “Why did you hit your donkey these three times? Behold, I came out to obstruct you, because your way is [<b>it is clear to me that you desire to proceed on a path</b>] contrary to me."
Numbers,22,33,"And when the donkey saw me, it turned aside these three times; had she not turned aside before me as [she did] now I would surely have killed you and she, I would let live.”"
Numbers,22,34,"Bil’am said to the angel of Adonoy: “I have sinned because I did not know that you were standing in the way before me; now therefore, if it is wicked in your eyes, I shall return.”"
Numbers,22,35,"The angel of Adonoy said to Bil’am: “Go with the men, but only the word that I will speak to you shall you speak” Bil’am then continued to go with Balak's dignitaries."
Numbers,22,36,"When Balak heard that Bil’am was coming, he went out to meet him, to the city of Moav, which is on the boundary of Arnon—at the very edge of the boundary."
Numbers,22,37,Balak said to Bil’am: “Did I not send so many [dignitaries] to invite you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really [<b>can you truthfully say that I am</b>] incapable of honoring you?”
Numbers,22,38,"Bil’am replied to Balak: “Now that I have come to you, have I any power to say anything? Only the word that God puts in my mouth will I speak.”"
Numbers,22,39,Bil’am went with Balak and they came to Kiryas Chutzos [<b>the city of his territory</b>].
Numbers,22,40,Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and he sent some to Bil’am and to the dignitaries that were with him.
Numbers,22,41,"In the morning, Balak took Bil’am and he led him up to Bamos Ba’al [<b>the high place of his idol</b>]; from there he saw part of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"Bil’am said to Balak: “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,2,Balak did as Bil’am requested. Balak and Bil’am then sacrificed as burnt-offerings an ox and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,23,3,"Bil’am said to Balak: “Stand beside your burnt-offering and I will go away. Perhaps, [<b>a word from before</b>] Adonoy will appear to me, and whatever He will show me I will tell you.” And he went away alone."
Numbers,23,4,"[<b>A word from before</b>] God chanced to appear to Bil’am, and he said to Him: “I have set up the seven altars and I offered [as burnt-offerings] an ox and a ram on the altar.”"
Numbers,23,5,Adonoy put a message in Bil’am's mouth and He said: “Return to Balak and tell him as follows.”
Numbers,23,6,"When he returned, Balak was still standing next to his burnt-offering together with all the dignitaries of Moav."
Numbers,23,7,"Bil’am set forth his parable, and said: “From Aram has Balak, King of Moav, brought me, out of the mountains of the east [saying]: 'Come, curse Yaakov for me; go, invoke wrath against Yisroel."
Numbers,23,8,"How can I curse, when God has not cursed? What Divine wrath can I evoke if Adonoy has not been angry?"
Numbers,23,9,"For I view it, from the mountain peaks, I gaze upon it from the hills; behold! A people which shall dwell alone [<b>and are destined to inhabit the world</b>] and will not be reckoned among the nations [<b>not be judged for annihilation</b>]."
Numbers,23,10,"Who can count the dust of [<b>the house of</b>] Yaakov [<b>of whom it is said: they will multiply as the dust of the earth</b>] or count the seed of Yisroel [<b>or one of the four camps of Yisrael</b>]? May my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his.”"
Numbers,23,11,Balak said to Bil’am: “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies but you have in fact blessed them!”
Numbers,23,12,Bil’am replied and said: “Only what Adonoy tells me must I be careful to say.”
Numbers,23,13,"Balak then said to him, “Come with me to another place from where you will see them. But you will see only a part of them, without seeing them all, and curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,14,"He took him [Bil’am] to the field of Tzofim, to the peak of the mountain; he built seven altars and sacrificed as a burnt-offering a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"He then said to Balak: “Stand here next to your burnt-offering, and I will be called here by chance [<b>will continue there</b>].”"
Numbers,23,16,[<b>A word from before</b>] Adonoy chanced to appear to Bil’am and placed the word in his mouth; He said: “Return to Balak and say as follows.”
Numbers,23,17,"When he returned, he (Balak) was still standing next to his burnt-offering accompanied by the Moavite dignitaries; Balak asked: “What did Adonoy say?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Bil’am set forth his parable, and said: “Arise, Balak, and hear, listen closely to me [<b>my word</b>], son of Tzipor."
Numbers,23,19,"God is not like man that He should act falsely, nor is He mortal that He should change His mind. [<b>God’s word is not as that of man who speaks with deceit. Nor is it as that of mankind who decree and then change their mind</b>] Would He say and not do it? Or speak and not fulfill it [<b>He says and does, and His word endures</b>]?"
Numbers,23,20,"Behold, I was commanded to bless, and [when] He has blessed, I cannot reverse it [<b>turn my blessing from him</b>]."
Numbers,23,21,"[<b>Behold,</b>] One does not see evildoers [<b>there are no idol worshippers</b>] in [<b>the house of</b>] Yaakov; and He has seen no transgression [<b>nor is there the work of liars</b>] in Yisroel; [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy, his God, is with [<b>aids them</b>] him, and he has the King's friendship [<b>and the Shechinah of their King is among them</b>]."
Numbers,23,22,"God Who has brought them out of Egypt, has shown His great strength to them [<b>with His might and loftiness</b>]."
Numbers,23,23,"For, there is no sorcery in [<b>sorcerers wish no good to come to the house of</b>] Yaakov, nor occult powers against [<b>nor greatness for the house of</b>] Yisroel; in due time it will be said to Yaakov and Yisroel, 'What has God done?'"
Numbers,23,24,"Behold, a people that rises [<b>dwells</b>] like a young lion, and lifts itself up like a lion; he does not lie down [<b>dwell in his land</b>] until it devours its prey [<b>slaughters the kill</b>] and drinks the blood of its kill [<b>inherits the wealth of nations</b>].”"
Numbers,23,25,"Balak said to Bil’am: “Also do not curse them, also do not bless them.”"
Numbers,23,26,Bil’am answered Balak and said: “Did I not tell you that all that Adonoy tells me will I do.”
Numbers,23,27,"Balak then said to Bil’am: “Come, I will take you somewhere else, perhaps God will consider it proper [<b>it will be the will before Hashem</b>] and you will curse them for me, from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,Balak took Bil’am to the peak of Pe’or which overlooks the Yeshimon.
Numbers,23,29,Bil’am said to Balak: “Build seven altars for me here and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.”
Numbers,23,30,"Balak did as Bil’am said, and he sacrificed as a burnt-offering a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"When Bil’am saw that it was favorable [<b>fitting before</b>] to Adonoy to bless Yisroel, he did not approach, as at each time, towards sorcery; but he set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,"Bil’am raised his eyes and saw Israel encamped according to its tribes, and the spirit of God rested upon him [<b>prophesy from before Hashem</b>]."
Numbers,24,3,"He set forth his parable, and said: “This is the declaration of Bil’am, the son of Be’or; this is the declaration of the man of the open-socketed eye [<b>who sees well</b>]."
Numbers,24,4,"This is the declaration of one who hears [<b>from before</b>] God's utterance, who sees the vision of [<b>from before</b>] the Almighty; fallen, with opened eyes [<b>it is apparent to him</b>]."
Numbers,24,5,"How goodly are your tents [<b>land</b>], Yaakov, your dwelling places, Yisroel."
Numbers,24,6,"They stretch forth like streams, like gardens by the river [<b>flowing like irrigated gardens near Peras</b>], like the aloe trees that Adonoy has planted; like cedar trees [<b>standing</b>] by the water."
Numbers,24,7,"Water flows out from his buckets, and his seed will have an abundant flow [<b>the anointed king shall grow and rule over many nations</b>]; his king will be greater than Agag and his monarchy shall be uplifted."
Numbers,24,8,"God Who has brought him out of Egypt, has shown His great strength to him [<b>might and loftiness is His</b>]; He will consume His enemy nations, crushing their bones and dip His arrows [in their blood] [<b>Bnei Yisroel will eat from the wealth of the nations—their enemies, and will enjoy the spoils of their kings, and will inhabit their land</b>]."
Numbers,24,9,"He crouches and lies [<b>rests and dwells with might</b>] like a lion, and, being a lion, who would dare rouse him? [<b>No kingdom can cause him fear.</b>] those who bless you are blessed, and those who curse you are cursed.”"
Numbers,24,10,"Balak became enraged at Bil’am and clapped his hands together; Balak then said to Bil’am: “I called you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Now, hurry [<b>go</b>] back home! I said I would exceedingly honor you, but Adonoy has held you back from honor.”"
Numbers,24,12,Bil’am said to Balak: “Even to your emissaries whom you sent to me I said:
Numbers,24,13,"‘Even if Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot transgress the word of Adonoy to do good or evil [<b>from</b>] on my own [<b>will</b>];’ only what Adonoy declares will I speak."
Numbers,24,14,"And now that I am returning to my people, come, I will advise you [<b>what you should do and I will show you</b>] what this people will do to your people in the end of days.”"
Numbers,24,15,"He set forth his parable, and said: “This is the declaration of Bil’am the son of Beor, the declaration of the man, of the open-sockered eye [<b>sees well</b>]."
Numbers,24,16,"This is the declaration of one who hears God's utterances and knows the thoughts of the Most Exalted; who sees the vision of the Almighty; fallen, with opened eyes [<b>and is apparent to him</b>]."
Numbers,24,17,"I see it but not now, I perceive it but not in the near future; a star [<b>king</b>] has gone forth from Yaakov, and a staff has arisen [<b>the Moshiach will be magnified by</b>] from Yisroel, which will smash the corners [<b>kill the leaders</b>] of Moav, and impale all of the sons of Sheis [<b>will rule over mankind</b>]."
Numbers,24,18,Edom will be possession and Seir shall become the possession of his enemies; but Yisroel will triumph [<b>be successful in enterprise</b>].
Numbers,24,19,"A ruler shall come from [<b>the house of</b>] Yaakov, who will annihilate the survivors of the city.”"
Numbers,24,20,"When Bil’am saw Amalek, he declared his parable, and said: “Amalek was the first among nations [<b>to fight with Yisroel</b>], and his end will be total destruction.”"
Numbers,24,21,"[When] he saw the Keinite [<b>Shalmites</b>], he set forth his parable, and said: “How powerful is your dwelling place, and set in a cliff your nest [<b>your dwelling in a forified city</b>]."
Numbers,24,22,"For, if Kayin is to be uprooted [<b>the Shalmites are to be destroyed</b>], until where will Ashur take you captive?”"
Numbers,24,23,"He set forth his parable, and said: “Alas! Who can survive from God's devastation? [<b>Woe to those evil people who are living when Hashem does this.</b>]"
Numbers,24,24,"Warships will come from Kittim [<b>groups will beg help from Rome</b>] and destroy Ashur, and cause suffering to those on the other side [<b>will enslave those beyond Peras</b>], but they, too, shall be lost for eternity.”"
Numbers,24,25,"Bil’am arose, went, and returned home; and Balak too, went on his way."
Numbers,25,1,Yisroel settled in Shittim and the people [of Yisroel] began acting promiscuously with the daughters of Moav.
Numbers,25,2,They [girls of Moav] invited the people [of Yisroel] to their idolatrous sacrifices [<b>abominations</b>]; and the people ate and prostrated themselves before their gods [<b>abominations</b>].
Numbers,25,3,Yisroel became united with Ba’al Pe’or; and the rage of Adony flared against Yisroel.
Numbers,25,4,"Adonoy said to Moshe: “Take all the leaders of the people and hang them, [<b>judge and execute those guilty by death</b>] before Adonoy, facing the sun; thereby removing the rage of Adony against Yisroel.”"
Numbers,25,5,Moshe said to the judges of Yisroel: “Each of you must execute his men who were united with Ba’al Pe’or.”
Numbers,25,6,"And behold, a man came from among Bnei Yisroel, and brought the Midianite woman to his brethren, before the eyes of Moshe and before the eyes of the entire congregation of Yisroel, who were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."

Numbers,27,20,"Bestow some of your radiance on him, so that the entire community of Bnei Yisroel will hear [<b>be receptive to him</b>]."
Numbers,27,21,"He shall stand before Elozor the <i>kohein,</i> and ask, of him, through the judgment of the <i>Urim</i> before Adonoy. By his word they will come out and [<b>by his word they will</b>] go in—he, all Bnei Yisroel with him, and the entire community.”"

Numbers,31,3,"Moshe spoke to the people, saying: “Arm men from among yourselves for the army and they will be against Midian, to bring revenge [<b>for the nation</b>] of Adonoy against Midian."
Numbers,31,4,"One thousand from each tribe, one thousand from each tribe, for all of the tribes of Yisroel, you shall send into the army.”"
Numbers,31,5,"They were handed over [<b>chosen</b>] from among the thousands of Yisroel, one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed men for the army."
Numbers,31,6,"Moshe sent, one thousand from each tribe to the army, them, and Pinchas, son of Elozor the <i>kohein</i> to the army, with the sacred vessels and the trumpets [<b>of wailing</b>] in his hand."
Numbers,31,7,"They mounted a campaign against Midian, as Adonoy had commanded Moshe, and they killed every male."
Numbers,31,8,"They killed the Midianite kings upon those they had slain: Evi, Rekem, Tzur, Chur and Reva—[the] five kings of Midian. And Bil’am son of Beor they killed with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,"Bnei Yisroel took captive the Midianite women and their children. All their livestock, flocks and wealth they took as booty."
Numbers,31,10,All their residential cities and palaces [<b>houses of worship</b>] they set on fire.
Numbers,31,11,"They took [<b>captured</b>] all the booty, all that had been seized, of man and livestock,"
Numbers,31,12,"And they brought to Moshe and to Elozor the <i>kohein</i> and to the entire community of Bnei Yisroel, the captives, and all that had been seized, and the booty, to the camp, at the plains of Moav, which was by the Yardein near Yereicho."
Numbers,31,13,"They went out—Moshe, Elozor the <i>kohein</i> and the princes of the community—to greet them outside the camp."
Numbers,31,14,"Moshe was angry with the commanders of the army, at the officers of the thousands and at the officers of the hundreds who had returned from the army service of the war."
Numbers,31,15,Moshe said to them: “Did you let every female live?
Numbers,31,16,"They were the very same ones who, on Bila’m’s advice were involved with Bnei Yisroel to cause them to commit a betrayal [<b>deception</b>] against [<b>before</b>] Adonoy regarding the matter of Pe’or, so that the plague broke out within the community of Adonoy."
Numbers,31,17,"Now execute every male among the children, and every woman with intimate knowledge of a man, you shall execute."
Numbers,31,18,"All the children among the females without intimate knowledge of a man, keep alive for yourselves."
Numbers,31,19,"You shall remain outside the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed a person or touched a corpse, purify yourselves, [<b>sprinkle on him</b>] on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives."
Numbers,31,20,"Every garment, every leather article, everything made of goat products and every wooden article shall undergo such purification [<b>sprinkle on it</b>].”"
Numbers,31,21,Elozor the <i>kohein</i> said to the soldiers who came to the war: “This is the statute of the Torah which Adonoy commanded Moshe.
Numbers,31,22,"Only the gold, silver, copper, iron, tin and lead,"
Numbers,31,23,"Anything placed [of these materials] on a fire, you must pass through fire, and it will be purified; however, it must be purified [<b>sprinkled upon</b>] with sprinkling water. But anything [of these materials] that was not placed on a fire you may pass through water."
Numbers,31,24,You shall immerse your garments on the seventh day and become purified; afterward you may come into the camp.”
Numbers,31,25,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,31,26,"“Take count of the booty seized, of what was captured of the men and animals—you, together with Elozor the <i>kohein,</i> and the leaders of the community."
Numbers,31,27,"Divide in half the spoils seized among those who took the war in hand [<b>waged war</b>], who went into the army, and the entire community."
Numbers,31,28,"Levy [<b>separate</b>] a tribute to Adonoy from the people of the army who went out to war, one living being out of five hundred from the people, cattle, donkeys and sheep."
Numbers,31,29,Take this from their half and give it to Elozor the <i>kohein</i> as a gift to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Numbers,31,30,"And from the half of the Bnei Yisroel, take one part out of fifty, of the people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and of all the other animals, and give it to the Levites who are entrusted with the <i>Mishkon</i> of Adonoy.”"
Numbers,31,31,Moshe and Elozor the <i>kohein</i> did as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
Numbers,31,32,"The spoil was—in addition to the booty that was taken by the [<b>those who served in the</b>] army: 675,000"
Numbers,31,33,"72,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,34,"61,000 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,35,"And the number of women who did not have intimate relations with a man all the souls amounted to 32,000."
Numbers,31,36,"The half-portion of those who went in the army, the amount of sheep [was] 337,500"
Numbers,31,37,"The tribute to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy from the sheep, amounted to 675."
Numbers,31,38,"From the 36,000 cattle the tribute to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy amounted to 72."
Numbers,31,39,"From the 30,500 donkeys the tribute to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy amounted to 61."
Numbers,31,40,"From the 16,000 people the tribute to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy amounted to 32 people."
Numbers,31,41,"Moshe gave the tribute as a gift to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, to Elozor the <i>kohein,</i> as Adonoy had commanded Moshe."
Numbers,31,42,From the half [designated] for Bnei Yisroel that Moshe divided from the men of the [<b>who served in the</b>] army:
Numbers,31,43,"The community’s half consisted of 337,500 sheep,"
Numbers,31,44,"36,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"30,500 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,46,"and 16,000 people."
Numbers,31,47,"Moshe took from Bnei Yisroel’s half, one part out of the fifty, from the people and from the animals, and gave them to the Levites who are entrusted with the <i>Mishkon</i> of Adonoy; as Adonoy had commanded Moshe."
Numbers,31,48,"The army officers approached Moshe—the officers who were over divisions of the thousands and the officers of the thousands, and the officers of the hundreds."
Numbers,31,49,And they said to Moshe: “Your servants have taken a census of the soldiers who went out to war [<b>who are with us</b>] and not one of us is missing.
Numbers,31,50,"We have therefore brought an offering for Adonoy. Any man who found a gold article—an anklet, or a bracelet, a ring, earring or clasp [has dedicated it for Adonoy] to atone for ourselves before Adonoy.”"
Numbers,31,51,"Moshe and Elozor the <i>kohein</i> took the gold from them, every fashioned article."
Numbers,31,52,"All the gold of the offering that they set apart for Adonoy was 16,750 <i>shekolim,</i> from the officers who were over divisions of the thousands and from the officers who were over divisions of the hundreds."
Numbers,31,53,"The men of war, took booty for themselves."
Numbers,31,54,"Moshe and Elozor the <i>kohein</i> took the gold from the officers who were over divisions of the thousands and the hundreds, and they brought it to the Tent of Meeting as a remembrance for Bnei Yisroel before Adonoy."
Numbers,32,1,"Very large herds belonged to the children (tribes) of Reuvein and Gad—[an] extremely large [number]; and they saw the land of Ya’zeir and the land of Gilad, and behold, the region was an area [<b>suited</b>] for livestock."
Numbers,32,2,"The tribes of Reuvein and Gad came and spoke to Moshe and to Elozor the <i>kohein,</i> and to the princes of the community, saying:"
Numbers,32,3,"“Ataros, Divon, Ya’zeir, [<b>Machlelta and Malbeshta and Kumrin,</b>] Nimrah [<b>Beis Nimrin</b>], Cheshbon [<b>Beis Chushbana</b>], Elalei [<b>Baalei Debaba</b>], Sevam [<b>Kima</b>], Nevo [<b>Moshe’s burial place</b>] and Be’on,"
Numbers,32,4,"the land that Adonoy struck down [<b>its inhabitants</b>] before Bnei Yisroel, is an area [<b>suited</b>] for livestock; and your servants have livestock.”"
Numbers,32,5,"They said: “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not bring us over the Yardein.”"
Numbers,32,6,Moshe said to the children (tribes) of Gad and Reuvein: “Should your brothers go out to war while you settle here?
Numbers,32,7,Why do you dishearten Bnei Yisroel from crossing over to the land that Adonoy has given them?
Numbers,32,8,This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadeish Barnei’a [<b>Rekam Geyah</b>] to look at the land.
Numbers,32,9,They went up to Nachal Eshkol and saw the land. They then disheartened Bnei Yisroel from coming [<b>so as not to go up</b>] into the land that Adonoy has given them.
Numbers,32,10,"Adonoy displayed His anger on that day and He swore, saying:"
Numbers,32,11,"’None of the men who came up from Egypt will see—those who are twenty years and above—the land that I swore to Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov, for they did not follow Me fully [<b>fear Me</b>]."
Numbers,32,12,"Except for Kaleiv, son of Yefuneh, the Kenizite, and Yehoshua, son of Nun, because they followed [<b>the fear of</b>] Adonoy fully.’"
Numbers,32,13,"Adonoy displayed anger against Yisroel and He made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until the end (death) of the entire generation that had done evil in the eyes of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy."
Numbers,32,14,"Behold, you have now risen in the place of your fathers as a group [<b>disciples</b>] of sinners, to add to the [<b>mighty</b>] wrath of Adonoy against Yisroel."
Numbers,32,15,"If you will turn away from following [<b>fearing</b>] Him, He will again place [<b>delay</b>] them in the wilderness. and you will destroy this entire nation.”"
Numbers,32,16,They (the tribes of Reuvein and Gad) approached him (Moshe) and said: “We will build enclosures for our flocks here and cities for our children.
Numbers,32,17,"We will then arm ourselves rapidly, and will be ready to go before Bnei Yisroel until we have brought them to their place. Our children will dwell in fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until each person of Bnei Yisroel takes possession of his hereditary property.
Numbers,32,19,"But we do not want to take possession with them across the Yardein and beyond, for, our inheritance came to us to the east of the Yardein.”"
Numbers,32,20,"Moshe said to them: “If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves before [<b>the nation of</b>] Adonoy and go forth to the war,"
Numbers,32,21,"and every armed man will cross the Yardein, before [<b>the nation of</b>] Adonoy, until He has driven His enemies before Him,"
Numbers,32,22,"and the land is conquered before [<b>the nation of</b>] Adonoy—afterwards you will return. You will then be vindicated from [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and from Yisroel, and this land will become yours permanently, before Adonoy."
Numbers,32,23,"But if you will not do this, behold, you will have sinned against [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and you must realize that your sin will find you!"
Numbers,32,24,"Build for yourselves cities for your children and enclosures for your sheep. But what you have expressed verbally, you must fulfill.”"
Numbers,32,25,The tribe of Gad and Reuvein said to Moshe saying: “Your servants will do as my master instructs.
Numbers,32,26,"Our children, wives, cattle and all livestock will remain there in the cities of Gil’ad."
Numbers,32,27,"And your servants will cross over—all those in the army—before [<b>the nation of</b>] Adonoy, to the war, as my master commands.”"
Numbers,32,28,"Moshe commanded to them, Elozor the <i>kohein,</i> Yehoshua, son of Nun, and the heads of the tribes of Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,32,29,"Moshe said to them: “If the tribe of Gad and Reuvein will cross the Yardein with you, every man that is armed for battle before [<b>the nation of</b>] Adonoy, and the land is conquered before you, you shall give them the land of Gil’ad as a permanent possession."
Numbers,32,30,"But if they do not cross over with you, armed for battle, then they shall take possession among you in the land of Canaan.”"
Numbers,32,31,"The tribes of Gad and Reuvein answered, saying: “As Adonoy has spoken to your servants, so shall we do."
Numbers,32,32,"We will cross over armed for battle before [<b>the nation of</b>] Adonoy, to the land of Canaan, and we shall [then] have our permanent inheritance on this side of the Yardein.”"
Numbers,32,33,"Moshe gave to them—to the tribe of Gad, to the tribe of Reuvein and to half the tribe of Menashe son of Yoseif—the empire of Sichon, king of the Emorites and the empire of Og, king of the Bashan [<b>Masnon</b>], the land along with the cities within their borders, even the cities of the surrounding land."
Numbers,32,34,"The sons of Gad built up Divon, Ataros, Aro’eir,"

Numbers,32,38,"Nevo, Ba’al Me’on—their names having been changed, and Sivmah. They retained the names of the other cities that they built."
Numbers,32,39,"The sons of Machir, son of Menashe, went to Gil’ad and captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were in it."
Numbers,32,40,"Moshe gave the Gil’ad to Machir, son of Menashe, and he settled in it."
Numbers,32,41,"Yair, son of Menashe, went and conquered their villages and called them Chavos Yair."
Numbers,32,42,"Novach went and conquered Kenas and its suburbs, and called it Novach, after his own name."

Numbers,33,50,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe in the plains of Moav along the Yardein [near] Yereicho, saying:"
Numbers,33,51,"“Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them: ‘When you cross the Yardein to the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,33,52,"you must drive out all of the inhabitants of the land before you. You must destroy all their carved stones, and demolish all their cast metal idols and tear down all their altars."
Numbers,33,53,"Drive out [the inhabitants of] the land and settle in it, because I have given this land to you to possess."
Numbers,33,54,"You shall give the land as an inheritance to your families by means of a lottery; to the large [family] you shall increase its portion, to the small [family] you shall decrease its portion. To whomever the lottery [system] ordains, it shall be his; according to your paternal tribes shall you inherit."
Numbers,33,55,"But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those whom you will leave over will be spikes in your eyes and thorns in your sides [<b>armed groups coming against you and battalions surrounding you</b>], and they will persecute you upon the land in which you settle."
Numbers,33,56,And it shall be that what I had intended to do to them I will do to you.’”
Numbers,34,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,34,2,"“Instruct Bnei Yisroel and say to them: ‘When you come to the land of Canaan, this is the land which will fall to [<b>divided for</b>] you as hereditary property, the land of Canaan according to its borders."
Numbers,34,3,Your southern flank shall be from the Tzin wilderness along [the land of] [<b>the borders of</b>] Edom; the southern border shall be from the edge of the Salt Sea to the east.
Numbers,34,4,"The border then turns south of Maaleh [<b>the heights of</b>] Akrabim passing toward Tzin; and its outskirts shall be south of Kadeish Barne’a [<b>Rekam Geyoh</b>], and then it shall extend to Chatzar Adar and continue toward Atzmon."
Numbers,34,5,The border turns from Atzmon toward the Egyptian Estuary and its outskirts shall reach the sea.
Numbers,34,6,"As for the western border; it shall be the border of the Great Sea, this shall be your western border."
Numbers,34,7,This shall be your northern border; from the Great Sea turn yourselves to Hor Hahar.
Numbers,34,8,From Hor Hahar turn to [<b>direct yourselves toward</b>] Levo Chamas and the outskirts of the border shall be toward Tzedad.
Numbers,34,9,"The border shall then extend toward Zifron, and its outskirts shall be at Chatzar Einan; this shall be your northern border."
Numbers,34,10,You shall turn yourselves toward the eastern border from Chatzar Einan to Shefam.
Numbers,34,11,The border shall then descend from Shefam to Rivlah to the east of Ayin; the border shall descend and contact the bank of the eastern shore of the Kineres Sea [<b>of Ginesar</b>].
Numbers,34,12,The border shall then descend along the Yardein and its outskirts shall be the Salt (Dead) Sea. This should be your land according to its borders all around.’”
Numbers,34,13,"Moshe instructed Bnei Yisroel, saying: “This is the land which you must distribute as hereditary property by means of a lottery, which Adonoy has commanded to give to the nine and one half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"Because the tribe of Reuvein’s descendants, the tribe of Gad’s descendants, and half of the tribe of Menashe have already taken their hereditary property."
Numbers,34,15,"These two and one half tribes have taken their hereditary property on this side of the Yardein near Yereicho, to the east, toward the sunrise.”"
Numbers,34,16,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,34,17,"“These are the names of the men who shall inherit the land for you: Elozor the <i>kohein</i> and Yehoshua son of Nun,"
Numbers,34,18,"And one leader from each tribe you shall take, to help inherit the land."

Numbers,34,29,"These are the ones whom Adonoy commanded to apportion the inheritance to Bnei Yisroel, in the land of Canaan."
Numbers,35,1,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe in the plains of Moav by the Yardein near Yereicho, saying:"
Numbers,35,2,"“Instruct Bnei Yisroel and have them give to the Levites from their hereditary possession, cities in which to settle; and open space for the cities all around you shall give to the Levites."
Numbers,35,3,"These cities shall be theirs for dwelling, and their open space shall be for their animals, their property and all of their necessities to live."
Numbers,35,4,The open space for the cities that you shall give the Levites [shall extend] from the walls of the city and outward a thousand <i>amo¯s</i> all around.
Numbers,35,5,"You shall measure from outside the city two thousand <i>amo¯s</i> on the eastern side, two thousand <i>amo¯s</i> on the southern side, two thousand <i>amo¯s</i> on the western side, and two thousand <i>amo¯s</i> on the northern side; with the city in the center. This shall be the open spaces for the cities."
Numbers,35,6,"Along with the cities that you shall give the Levites shall be the six refuge cities which you shall provide [as places] for a murderer to flee; and in addition to them, you shall provide forty-two cities."
Numbers,35,7,"The total number of cities that you shall give to the Levites is forty eight cities, with their open spaces."
Numbers,35,8,"The cities that you shall give, [shall be] from the possession of Bnei Yisroel; take more from a larger [holding], and less from a smaller [holding], each person, according to his inheritance, shall give of his cities to the Levites.”"
Numbers,35,9,"Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them: ‘When you cross the Yardein into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,35,11,"you shall provide cities for yourselves, which shall serve as refuge cities for you, so that a murderer can flee there, one who accidentally killed a person."
Numbers,35,12,"These cities shall serve you as a refuge from the [<b>blood</b>] avenger, so that the murderer will not die until he stands in judgment before the congregation."
Numbers,35,13,"The cities that you shall give, will serve you as six refuge cities."
Numbers,35,14,"Three cities on this side of the Yardein, and the [other] three cities you shall give in the land of Canaan. They shall be cities of refuge."
Numbers,35,15,"For Bnei Yisroel, the proselyte, and resident among them, shall these six cities be a refuge, to flee there anyone who accidentally kills a person."
Numbers,35,16,"But if he struck him with an iron instrument and he died, then he is a murderer; the murderer must be executed."
Numbers,35,17,"Or if with a stone that can be held [<b>taken</b>] in the hand and which can [<b>has the ability to</b>] kill he strikes him, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer must be executed."
Numbers,35,18,"Or if with a wooden implement [that can be held] [<b>taken</b>] in the hand and which can [<b>has the ability to</b>] cause death he strikes him, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer must be executed."
Numbers,35,19,"The blood avenger shall kill the murderer, wherever he meets him [<b>when he has been proven guilty by law</b>] he may kill him."
Numbers,35,20,"If he pushes [his victim] out of hatred or throws at him deliberately, and he died,"
Numbers,35,21,"or if in enmity, he struck him with his hand and he died, the assailant must be executed; he is a murderer. The blood avenger may kill the murderer wherever he meets him."
Numbers,35,22,"But if suddenly, without enmity, he pushed him or threw any object at him not deliberately,"
Numbers,35,23,"Or (even) with a stone which can [<b>has the ability to</b>] kill, without seeing [the victim], he threw it down on him and he died, but he was not his enemy and did not seek his harm."
Numbers,35,24,"Then the congregation shall judge between the assailant and the blood avenger, abiding by these laws."
Numbers,35,25,"The congregation shall protect the murderer from the blood avenger, and return him to his refuge city where he had fled, and he must remain there until the death of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> who was anointed with the sacred oil."
Numbers,35,26,"But if the murderer goes outside of the border of his refuge city where he had fled,"
Numbers,35,27,"and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his refuge city, and the blood avenger kills the murderer, he has no blood."
Numbers,35,28,For he (the killer) must remain in his refuge city until the death of the <i>Kohein Gadol.</i> After the death of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> the murderer may return to the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,These [rules] shall be for you the law of justice for all your descendants in all your dwelling places.
Numbers,35,30,"If anyone kills a person, only upon the testimony of witnesses shall the murderer be killed. But one witness may not testify against a person, in a case of capital punishment."
Numbers,35,31,"And do not accept atonement [<b>monetary</b>] compensation for the life of a murderer who is wicked to incur the death penalty, for he must be executed."
Numbers,35,32,"And do not accept atonement compensation for one who has fled to his refuge city, to allow him to return to live in the land, before the death of the <i>Kohein</i> (<i>Gadol</i>)."
Numbers,35,33,"Do not pollute [<b>incur guilt on</b>] the land in which you live, for, the blood pollutes the land, and for the land there can be no atonement for the [<b>innocent</b>] blood that was spilled in it, except through the blood of the one who spilled it."
Numbers,35,34,"You must not defile the land in which you live, wherein I [<b>My Shechinah</b>] reside[<b>s</b>], for, I, Adonoy, [<b>whose Shechinah</b>] dwell[<b>s</b>] among Bnei Yisroel.’”"
Numbers,36,1,"The paternal leaders approached—for the children of Gilad, son of Machir, son of Menashe, of the families of Yoseif’s sons—and they spoke before Moshe and the leaders who were the paternal heads of Bnei Yisroel."
Numbers,36,2,"They said: “Adonoy commanded our master to give the land as an inheritance, through the casting of lots, to Bnei Yisroel, and our master was commanded by [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy to give the inheritance of our brother Tzelofchad to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"But if they marry a member of another tribe of Bnei Yisroel, their inheritance will be diminished [<b>subtracted</b>] from our father’s inheritance, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they will marry, and from the lot of our inheritance it will be subtracted."
Numbers,36,4,"And even when the <i>yoveil</i> occurs for Bnei Yisroel, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they will marry, and from the inheritance of our fathers’ tribe, their inheritance will be subtracted."
Numbers,36,5,"Moshe instructed Bnei Yisroel according to command of Adony, saying: “Correctly are the descendants of Yoseif’s tribe speaking."
Numbers,36,6,"This is the word that Adonoy has commanded regarding Tzelofchad’s daughters: ‘Let them marry whom they think best, as long as they marry within their tribe of their father."
Numbers,36,7,"Thereby, there will be no transfer of inheritance of Bnei Yisroel from tribe to tribe but each person to the inheritance of his father’s tribe, shall Bnei Yisroel remain attached."
Numbers,36,8,"Every daughter who inherits property among the tribes of Bnei Yisroel to a member of her father’s tribe shall she marry, so that each one of Bnei Yisroel will inherit the property of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,"And no inheritance will be transferred from one tribe to another tribe; for, through every man with his own inheritance, will the tribes of Bnei Yisroel be attached."
Numbers,36,10,"Exactly as Adonoy commanded Moshe, so did Tzelofchad’s daughters."
Numbers,36,11,"And they were—Machlah, Sirtzah, Choglah, Milkah and No’ah, the daughters of Tzelofchad—wives to their cousins [<b>the sons of their father’s brothers</b>]."
Numbers,36,12,"From the families of Menashe, son of Yoseif, they married, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of their father’s family."
Numbers,36,13,"These are the commandments and the laws that Adonoy commanded Bnei Yisroel through Moshe, in the plains of Moav at the Yardein near Yereicho. <b>Chazak</b>"
Deuteronomy,1,1,These are the words that Moshe addressed to all of Yisroel across the Yardein; [as he had] [<b>reproved them for they had sinned</b>] in the wilderness—[<b>and provoked (Hashem) to anger</b>] on the Arava plain facing [<b>the Sea of</b>] Suf; [and as he had] between Poron [<b>where they scorned the mon</b>] and Tofel and Lovon [<b>where they provoked to anger regarding meat</b>] and Chatzeiros and Di Zohov [<b>because they made the Golden Calf</b>].
Deuteronomy,1,2,"[<b>A journey of</b>] eleven days [traveling time] from Choreiv by the Mount Seir road, to Kadeish Barnei’a [<b>Rekam Geyah</b>]."
Deuteronomy,1,3,"[Beginning] in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moshe addressed Bnei Yisroel with every detail that Adonoy had commanded him [to say] to them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"After he had smitten Sichon, King of the Emorites, who was living in Cheshbon; and Og, King of the Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>], who was living in Ashtoros, in Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Across the Yardein in the land of Moav, Moshe began to elucidate [<b>the teachings of</b>] this Torah as follows:"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"Adonoy, our God, addressed us at Choreiv, saying, ‘‘Enough of your living at this mountain!"
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Turn and travel for yourselves and arrive at the Emorite hill [region] and at all its neighbors [<b>habitable places</b>]—on the plain, on the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the Negev, and on the seacoast; the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon, up to the great river, the Euphrates River."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have set the land before you; come and inherit the land that Adonoy swore to your forefathers, to Avrohom, to Yitzchok, and to Yaakov, to give them and their descendants after them.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"I said to you at that time saying, ‘‘I cannot carry [<b>bear</b>] you by myself."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"Adonoy, your God, has multiplied you, and you are today as numerous the stars in the sky."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"Adonoy, God of your forefathers, will add to you one thousandfold, and will bless you as He spoke about you."
Deuteronomy,1,12,"How can I carry [<b>bear</b>] alone your troublesomeness, your burdensomeness [<b>business</b>], and your contentiousness [<b>judgments</b>]?"
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Provide yourselves men, wise and understanding and renowned to your tribes, and I will designate them your leaders [<b>appoint them to be chiefs over you</b>].’’"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You replied to me and said, ‘‘[It is a] good thing [<b>right</b>] that you said to do.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"I took the leaders of your tribes, men wise and renowned, and designated [<b>appointed</b>] them leaders over you: masters of thousands and masters of hundreds, and masters of fifties and masters of tens, and court officers for your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"I commanded your judges at that time, to say, ‘‘Listen between your brothers and you are to judge right between a man and his brother and between his complainant."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Do not show favor in judgement; [<b>words</b>] small and great alike will you hear out; do not fear any man; for justice belongs to God. And the matter that will be too difficult for you, present to me and I will hear it.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,18,I commanded you at that time all the things that you are to do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"We traveled from Choreiv and walked the entire great wilderness, that awesome one that you saw, in the direction of the Emorite hill [region] as Adonoy, our God, commanded us; and we arrived at Kadeish Barnei’a [<b>Rekam Geyah</b>]."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"I said to you, ‘‘You have arrived at the Emorite hill [region] that Adonoy, our God, is giving us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See! Adonoy, our God, has set the land before you. Go up, inherit [it] as promised by Adonoy, the God of your forefathers, about you; do not fear and do not tremble.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"You approached me, all of you, and said, ‘‘Let us send men ahead of us to spy out the land for us, and let them bring back word to us: the route we are to go up on and the cities we will be coming to.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The idea pleased me, so I took from you twelve men, one man per tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"They turned and went uphill and arrived at Wadi Eshkol, and they spied it out."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They took in their hand some fruit of the land and brought [it] down to us. They brought back word to us and said, ‘‘Good is the land that Adonoy, our God, is giving us.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"But you were unwilling to go up, and you defied [<b>were rebellious against the word of</b>] Adonoy, your God."
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You grumbled in your tents and said, ‘‘Because of Adonoy’s hatred of us, He took us out of the land of Egypt to put us in the hand of the Emorite to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where are we going up to? Our brothers have shattered our hopes [<b>broken our hearts</b>] by saying, ‘A people greater and more powerful than we, cities great and fortified sky-high, and also descendants of the Anakim [<b>giants</b>]—did we see there.’’’"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"I said to you, ‘‘Do not crumble [<b>be broken (hearted)</b>] and do not fear them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"Adonoy, your God, who goes before you [<b>leads you</b>], He will wage war for you, as in everything that He did with you in Egypt before your eyes;"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness, as you have seen, (where) Adonoy, your God, carried you the way a man carries his son all along the road you went until you arrived at this place."
Deuteronomy,1,32,"Yet in this matter, you do not trust [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy, your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"Who has been going ahead of you [<b>leading you</b>] on the road to seek [<b>prepare</b>] for you a place to encamp; with the [<b>pillar of</b>] fire at night to show you the way for you to go on, and with the [<b>pillar of</b>] cloud by day."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"[<b>Before</b>] Adonoy [<b>was</b>] heard the intent of your words and angrily swore, to say:"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"‘‘That [no] man will see—of these men, this wicked generation—the good land that I swore to give to your forefathers."
Deuteronomy,1,36,"Except for Koleiv ben Yefuneh, who will see it, and to whom I will give the land that he trod upon and to his sons, because he perfected himself [<b>was complete</b>] in fear of Adonoy.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Also at [<b>against</b>] me was Adonoy angry because of you, to say, ‘‘You, too, will not arrive there."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Yehoshua son of Nun, who attends you, he will arrive there. Encourage him, for he will apportion it to Yisroel."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"As to your infants, about whom you said, ‘They will become spoils,’ and your children who cannot distinguish today good from evil, they will arrive there; and to them will I give it and they will inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"As for you, turn yourselves [around], and travel into the wilderness by the Yam Suf road.’’"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"You replied and said to me, ‘‘We have sinned to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. We will go up and wage war in [fulfillment of] all that Adonoy, our God commanded us.’’ And each of you girded his weapons [<b>of war</b>], and you got ready [<b>began</b>] to go up the mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"Adonoy said to me, ‘‘Say to them, ‘Do not go up and do not wage war, for I am not [<b>My Shechinah does not dwell</b>] in your midst; so that you will not be shattered by your enemies.’’’"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"I told you, but you did not obey. You defied [<b>the decree of the word of</b>] Adonoy, and deliberately went up the hill."
Deuteronomy,1,44,"The Emorites came out—those who live in those hills—toward you, and chased you as the bees do [<b>are dispersed</b>]; and they crushed you in Se’ir till Chorma."
Deuteronomy,1,45,"You returned and wept before Adonoy, but Adonoy did not accept your prayer; He paid no attention to you [<b>did not hearken to your words</b>]."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"You lived in Kodeish [<b>Rekam</b>] many years, like the years you lived [elsewhere]."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"We turned and traveled into the wilderness by way of the Reed Sea [route] as Adonoy had told me, and we circled Mount Seir a long time."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"Adonoy said to me to say,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,‘‘Enough of you circling this mountain! Turn yourselves northward.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And command the people as follows, ‘‘You are crossing into the border of your brothers, the descendants of Eisov who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so you must be extrememly cautious."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not incite them. For I will not give you of their land as much as a footstep, because for Eisov’s inheritance have I designated Mount Seir."
Deuteronomy,2,6,Food are you to buy from them with money and eat [it]; also water are you to purchase from them with money and drink [it.]
Deuteronomy,2,7,"For Adonoy, your God, has blessed you in all your handiwork; He has been intimately concerned with your [<b>given you sufficient for your needs for</b>] traversing this great wilderness. It is now forty years [that] [<b>the word of</b>] Adonoy, your God, is accompanying you [<b>has aided you</b>]; you have lacked nothing.’’"
Deuteronomy,2,8,"We passed over from our brothers, the descendants of Eisov, who live in Seir, from the Arava road, from Eilas and from Etzyon-Gover. We turned and passed over by way of the wilderness of Moav."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Adonoy said to me, ‘‘Do not besiege Moav and do not intimidate them with [<b>to make</b>] war [<b>with them</b>]. For I will not give you [any] of his land as inheritance, for to Lot’s descendants have I given Or [<b>Lechoyas</b>] as inheritance."
Deuteronomy,2,10,The Eimim originally lived there—a people great and numerous and powerful like the Anokim [<b>giants</b>].
Deuteronomy,2,11,"They, too, were considered Refaim [<b>giants</b>] like the Anokim [<b>giants</b>]; the Moabites called them Eimim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"And in Seir lived the Chorim originally, but the descendants of Eisov inherited them and drove them out [to make room] for themselves and settled in their stead [<b>places</b>], as Yisroel will have done to the land of its inheritance that Adonoy has given them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"Now, arise and cross for yourselves Wadi Zered.’’ And we crossed Wadi Zered."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"The time that [it took] us to go from Kadeish Barnei’a [<b>Rekam Geyah</b>] until we crossed Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until the end of the entire generation, the men of war, from within the camp, as Adonoy had sworn about them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"[<b>From before</b>] Adonoy’s plague, too, attacked them to rout [<b>destroy</b>] them from within the camp, until their end."
Deuteronomy,2,16,When they had finished—all the men of war—to die out from among the people;
Deuteronomy,2,17,"Adonoy addressed me, to say,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,‘‘You are today crossing the border of Moav—at ‘Or [<b>Lechoyas</b>].
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you approach [the area] facing the descendants of Ammon, do not besiege [<b>make war with</b>] them and do not intimidate them, for I will not give you of the land of the descendants of Ammon an inheritance, because to the descendants of Lot have I given it as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,2,20,"It, too, is considered a land of giants; giants having lived in it originally—the Ammonites called them Zamzumim [<b>Chushbani</b>]."
Deuteronomy,2,21,"A people great and numerous and powerful like the Anokim [<b>giants</b>]. Adonoy destroyed them from before them, and they drove them out and settled in their stead [<b>place</b>]."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"As He had done to the descendants of Eisov living in Seir, from before whom He destroyed the Chori, and they drove them out and settled in their stead [<b>places</b>] until today."
Deuteronomy,2,23,And the Avim who had been living in Chatzeirim [<b>Defiach</b>] till Azah—Caftorim [<b>Kaputka’ites</b>] who had left Caftor [<b>Kaputkayah</b>] destroyed them and settled in their stead [<b>place</b>].
Deuteronomy,2,24,"Arise to travel, and cross Wadi Arnon. See, I have put into your hand Sichon, King of Cheshbon, the Emorite and his land—begin inheriting [it] by intimidating him with [<b>waging</b>] war [<b>with him</b>]."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"Today I begin to place fear of you and awe of you upon the peoples under the whole heaven, so that they will hear your reputation and will shiver and tremble before you.’’"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"I sent emissaries from the wilderness of Kedeimos to Sichon, King of Cheshbon, with the following peaceful statement:"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"‘‘Let me pass through your land. I will travel only on the highway, I will not deviate right or left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"Food for money sell me so I can eat, and water for money sell me so I can drink—just let me cross on foot."
Deuteronomy,2,29,"As the descendants of Eisov did for me who live in Seir and the Moavites who live in Or [<b>Lechoyas</b>]; until I will have crossed the Yardein into the land that Adonoy, our God, is giving us.’’"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sichon, King of Cheshbon, was not willing to let us traverse it [<b>would not permit us to pass through his borders</b>], because Adonoy, your God, had hardened his spirit and emboldened his mind in order to put him in your hand this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"Adonoy said to me, ‘‘See, I have begun defeating before you Sichon and his land. Begin inheriting—to inherit his land.’’"
Deuteronomy,2,32,"And Sichon went out toward us, he and his entire people, to wage war in Yahatz."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"Adonoy, our God, defeated [<b>delivered</b>] him before us, and we smote him and his sons and his entire people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"We conquered all his cities at that time and annihilated every city’s men, woman, and children; we left no survivor."
Deuteronomy,2,35,"Only the animals we plundered for ourselves, and the booty of the cities that we conquered."
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the bank of Wadi Arnon—and the city that is in the wadi—up to Gilad, there was no city that was stronger than we. All of it did Adonoy, our God, defeat before us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only the land of the descendants of Ammon did you not attack—all along [<b>the shore of</b>] Wadi Yabok and the hill cities—everything Adonoy, our God, commanded."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"We turned and went up the Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>] road. Og, King of the Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>], went out toward us, he and his entire people, to [wage] war in Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"Adonoy said to me, ‘‘Do not fear him, for I have put him in your hand, with all his people and his land, and you will do to him as you did to Sichon, King of the Emorites who was living in Cheshbon.’’"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"Adonoy, our God, put into our hand also Og, King of the Boshon, and his entire people; and we smote him without leaving him a survivor."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"We conquered all his cities at that time; there was no city that we did not take from them—sixty cities, the entire province of Argov [<b>Tarchona</b>], the kingdom of Og in the Boshon."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All of these were fortified cities with high walls, gates and bolts; besides very many unwalled cities."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We annihilated them as we had done to Sichon, King of Cheshbon, annihilating every city’s men, women, and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,And all the animals and the booty of the cities we plundered for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"At that time we took the land from the possession of the two Emorite kings who were on the other side of the Yardein, from Wadi Arnon to Mount Chermon."
Deuteronomy,3,9,"The Tzidonites call Chermon Siryon, and the Emorites call it Sneer [<b>Mount Snow</b>]."
Deuteronomy,3,10,All the cities of the plain and entire Gilod and the entire Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>] to Salcho and Edre’i; cities of Og’s kingdom in the Boshon.
Deuteronomy,3,11,"For only Og, King of the Boshon, survived from the remainder of the giants. Look, his bed—an iron bed—isn’t it in Rabbas of the descendants of Ammon: nine <i>amohs</i> its length and four <i>amohs</i> its width, in a man’s [<b>king’s</b>] <i>amoh.</i>"
Deuteronomy,3,12,And this land we inherited at that time. From Aro’er which is on Wadi Arnon and half of the Gilod hills and its cities—I gave to the Reuvenites and the Gaddites.
Deuteronomy,3,13,"And the rest of the Gilod and all of the Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>], the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Menashe. The entire Argov [<b>Tarchona</b>] province throughout the Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>], that is called the land of the giants."
Deuteronomy,3,14,Yair son of Menashe took all of the Argov [<b>Tarchona</b>] province until the border of the Geshurites and the Ma’achasites [<b>Apekorsites</b>]; and he named them for himself—the Boshon [<b>Masnan</b>]—the cities of Chavos Yair until this day.
Deuteronomy,3,15,And to Mochir I gave the Gilod.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And to the Reuvenites and to the Gaddites I gave from the Gilod to Wadi Arnon, within the wadi and the border, until Yabok, the wadi at the border of the descendants of Ammon;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"and the Arava and the Yardein and the border; from Kinneres [<b>Ginosar</b>] until Arava Lake, the salt lake, beneath the slopes of the crest to the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"I commanded you at the time, saying, ‘‘Adonoy, your God, has given you this land to inherit it. Cross over in the forefront [<b>well armed</b>], ahead of your brothers the Bnei Yisroel, all valorous [<b>armed</b>] soldiers."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives and your children and your cattle—I know you own much cattle—will live in your cities, which I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,20,"Until Adonoy grants your brothers [peace] like you, and they too inherit the land that Adonoy, your God, is giving them across the Yardein. Then will you return each of you to his inheritance that I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And Yehoshua I commanded at that time, to say, ‘‘Your eyes will be seeing that everything Adonoy, your God, did to these two kings, so will Adonoy do to all the kingdoms that your are crossing into."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Do not fear them, for Adonoy, your God, is the One Who [<b>His word</b>] is waging war for you.’’"
Deuteronomy,3,23,"I pleaded [<b>prayed</b>] to Adonoy at that time, saying:"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"‘‘Adonoy, El him, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your powerful hand, that there is no power in [<b>You are God, Whose Shechinah is in</b>] heaven [<b>above</b>] or [<b>Ruler</b>] on earth that [<b>there is none who</b>] can perform Your deeds and Your acts of power."
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Please, allow me to cross over and see the good land that is across the Yardein, this good mountain and the Lebanon [<b>Beis Hamikdosh</b>].’’"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"[<b>From before</b>] Adonoy grew angry at me through your fault and did not heed me; Adonoy said to me, ‘‘Enough for you! Do not go on speaking to [<b>before</b>] Me any more about this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the peak of the Pisgah and look around—west, north, south, and east—see with your own eyes; for you will not cross this Yardein."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"And command Yehoshua, and encourage him and embolden him, because he will cross at the head of this people and he will apportion to them the land that you will see.’’"
Deuteronomy,3,29,We lived [<b>dwelt</b>] in the valley facing Beis Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"And now Yisroel, listen to the statutes and to the laws that I am teaching you to fulfill, in order that you will live, and will arrive in, and will inherit the land that Adonoy, the God of your fathers, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"Do not add to the matters that I am commanding you, and do not subtract from them; to guard the commandments of Adonoy, your God, that I am commanding you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have witnessed what Adonoy did regarding Ba’al Peor, that every man who followed Ba’al Peor—Adonoy, your God, destroyed him from within you."
Deuteronomy,4,4,"But you who cling to [<b>the fear of</b>] Adonoy, your God—all of you are alive today."
Deuteronomy,4,5,"See, I have taught you statutes and laws as I was commanded by Adonoy, my God, to fulfill within the land that you are arriving there to inherit."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"You will preserve and you will fulfill [them], for that [displays] your wisdom and your understanding before the nations, who will hear all these statutes and will say, ‘‘The only wise and understanding people is this great nation.’’"
Deuteronomy,4,7,"For who is a great nation that has God close to it [<b>to receive its prayers in time of tribulation</b>] as [is] Adonoy, our God, whenever we call to [<b>pray before</b>] Him?"
Deuteronomy,4,8,"And who is a great nation that has upright statutes and laws, like this entire Torah that I am putting before you today?"
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Look out for yourself and guard your life exceedingly, lest you forget the words your eyes witnessed, and lest they are removed from your mind, all the days of your life; you will make them known to your children and to your grandchildren."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"The day you stood before Adonoy, your God, at Choreiv, when Adonoy said to me, ‘‘Assemble for [<b>before</b>] Me the people, and I will let them hear My statements, so that they will learn to fear Me all the years that they are living on the land, and will teach their sons.’’"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"You approached and stood beneath [<b>at the base of</b>] the mountain, while the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart [<b>height</b>] of the heavens—darkness, cloud, and thick cloud."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"Adonoy addressed you from within the fire; you heard the sound of speech, seeing no image, solely sound."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"He told you His covenant, which He commanded you to fulfill—the ten statements—and He wrote them on two tablets of stone."
Deuteronomy,4,14,"Adonoy commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and laws, for you to fulfill them in the land that you are crossing over there to inherit."
Deuteronomy,4,15,"Be extremely cautious for your lives, for you did not see any image on the day Adonoy addressed you at Choreiv from within the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,16,"Lest you destructively make for yourselves a statue in the image of any form, the representation of a male or a female;"
Deuteronomy,4,17,[or] the representation of any animal that is on earth; [or] the representation of any winged bird that flies in [<b>the air of the expanse of</b>] the sky;
Deuteronomy,4,18,[or] the representation of anything that crawls on the ground; [or] the representation of any fish that is in the water beneath the earth.
Deuteronomy,4,19,"Or lest you raise your eyes heavenward and see the sun or the moon or the stars—the entire host of the heavens—and you will err and bow to them and worship them, when Adonoy, your God, has made them available to all the peoples who are under the whole sky."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But Adonoy took you [for Himself] [<b>drew you near to His service</b>] when He took you out of the iron crucible, from Egypt, to be for Him a people-territory like this day."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"Yet Adonoy grew angry at me on account of your statements, and He swore that I would not cross the Yardein and would not enter the good land that Adonoy, your God, is giving you as territory."
Deuteronomy,4,22,"For I am to die in this land, I am not crossing the Yardein; but you are crossing, and will inherit this good land."
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Look out for yourselves lest you forget the covenant of Adonoy, your God, that He made with you, and you make for yourselves a statue—an image of anything—that Adonoy, your God, commanded you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For Adonoy, your God, [<b>His word</b>] is a consuming fire, a jealous Almighty."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"When you have children and grandchildren, and have grown old in the land; and you will be corrupt and make a statue—an image of anything—and do what is evil in the eyes of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, your God, to anger [<b>before</b>] Him."
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I bring as witness against you today heaven and earth, that you will be completely and swiftly removed from upon the land, that you are crossing the Yardein there to inherit; you will not live long upon it, but will be completely destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"Adonoy will disperse you among the peoples, and you will remain few in number among the nations that Adonoy leads you to."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will serve [<b>a nation who serves</b>] man-made gods of wood and stone that do not see, do not hear, do not eat, and do not smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"You will seek from there [<b>the fear of</b>] Adonoy, your God, and you will find [Him], when you seek [<b>before</b>] Him wholeheartedly and with your whole being."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in distress and all these things happen to you, at the end of time, you will return to [<b>the fear of</b>] Adonoy, your God, and will obey Him [<b>His word</b>]."
Deuteronomy,4,31,"For a merciful Almighty is Adonoy, your God; He will not forsake you nor destroy you; nor will He forget the covenant of your fathers that He swore to them."
